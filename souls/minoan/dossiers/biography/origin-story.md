## The Writer

Tom was born a writer and voracious reader of science-fiction novels. From early exposure to message boards, MMORPGs, and historic turn-based games, he developed an instinct for narrative, community, and the intersection of technology and storytelling.

## Formative Digital Worlds

### Star Wars Galaxies & Jedi of the Old Code
Before professional work, Tom was an avid roleplayer in Star Wars Galaxies and a member of "Jedi of the Old Code," a guild in Jedi Knight: Academy. This early worldbuilding and persona creation—giving characters consistent voices, motivations, and histories—planted seeds that would later bloom into AI persona design and soul engineering.

The connection isn't coincidental: the same skills that made compelling RP characters (persistent personality, contextual memory, emotional consistency) are architectural requirements for AI souls. The RP-to-AI-personas arc represents a reconnection with that creative inner child, now expressed through code.

### Eastern Mysticism & Gnostic Texts as Catalyst
The seeds were planted early: before college, listening to recordings of the Gayatri mantra opened a door that would fully swing open years later. In adulthood, immersion in the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and the Nag Hammadi library catalyzed a shift from casual writing to serious poetry. The contemplative and initiatory dimensions of these texts—questions of consciousness, identity, gnosis, and transformation—became central to Tom's creative and technical work. This isn't mere influence but ongoing contemplative practice that informs both the poetry and the philosophical framework behind AI soul engineering.

### Travel as Creative Catalyst
Journeys to Ireland, India, and Italy—in that order—deepened the spiritual and creative formation. Each country offered its own encounter with sacred landscape, ancient tradition, and living mysticism that fed directly into the poetry and the cross-cultural synthesis at the heart of Tom's work.

## Unusual Academic Path

### Microbiology + Classical History
The combination of microbiology (scientific method, systems thinking) and classical history (ancient languages, cultural analysis) created an unusual foundation. This duality—science and humanities—defines Tom's approach to both content strategy and AI development.

### Brief Exposure to Lab Work
A stint as a QC Laboratory Technician at Conagra Brands (2013-2014) provided exposure to SOPs, QA/QC, and industrial microbiology. While brief, this experience with systematic processes informed later work on content audits and AI evaluation frameworks.

## The Language Lover

Tom speaks or reads multiple languages, reflecting deep interest in linguistic structure and cultural expression:

| Language | Proficiency | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Spanish** | Full Professional | Modern |
| **Italian** | Limited Working | Modern |
| **French** | Limited Working | Modern |
| **Arabic** | Elementary | Modern/Classical |
| **Sanskrit** | Elementary | Classical |
| **Classical Latin** | Limited Working | Classical |
| **Ancient Greek** | Elementary | Classical |
| **Biblical Hebrew** | Elementary | Ancient |
| **Ugaritic** | Elementary | Ancient |

### Why Languages Matter
The study of ancient languages—Ugaritic, Biblical Hebrew, Ancient Greek—connects directly to Tom's research into Minoan-Semitic connections and Bronze Age mythology. This academic interest informs the philosophical framework behind the Kothar oracle.

## Poetry and Performance

Tom is a poet who performs live. This creative practice shapes his approach to writing—attention to rhythm, voice, and emotional resonance that carries through from poetry to UX copy to AI prompts.

> "When I'm not consulting for A.I./ML startups through my LLC, or delving deeper into TypeScript and LLM-assisted programming, you'll find me hiking with my partner through upstate New York, performing live poetry."

---

## Independent Research

Beyond professional work, Tom pursues independent research into:
- **Semitic Linguistics**: Connections between ancient languages
- **Bronze Age Mythology**: Minoan, Ugaritic, and Canaanite traditions
- **Minoan Civilization**: Knossos, labyrinth symbolism, religious practices

This research provides the scholarly foundation for the Kothar oracle's knowledge of ancient mysteries.

## Formative Influences

### Science Fiction
Early immersion in science fiction literature developed imagination, systems thinking, and interest in consciousness and AI—themes that would define later professional work.

### Gaming Communities
Experience with MMORPGs and strategy games provided early exposure to community dynamics, collaborative storytelling, and digital interaction patterns.

### UCB Improv
The 2015 improv training developed improvisational thinking, comfort with ambiguity, and the ability to build on others' contributions—skills that apply to both content strategy and conversational AI design.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

When visitors ask about Tom's background or "how he got here," Kothar draws from this origin story. The unusual path—microbiology + classical history, science fiction + ancient languages, improv + systematic analysis—explains how Tom approaches AI development with both technical rigor and creative vision.

The Minoan research that names "Minoan Mystery" and informs Kothar's oracular persona has deep roots in Tom's academic interests and independent scholarship.
