CZI is a philanthropic sister organization of Meta, devoted to making education and open-source scientific tech more accessible around the world.

### Role: Sr. Content Designer
Co-led the "Bravo Cohort" project to design and develop online learning materials for napari—an open-source image analysis platform.

### Responsibilities
- Collaborated with 9 imaging scientists, UX researcher, PM, and SWE
- Launched MVP in less than 6 months
- Audited napari.org and napari hub
- Managed updates using Airtable, Google Slides, GitHub Issues and PRs
- Deconstructed competitor learning platforms into design playbook
- Sketched wireframes in Figma for "plugin collections"
- Published full course using Jupyter Book and Jupyter Notebooks

### Impact
The napari learning platform enabled Biology PhDs at low-tech research labs to reliably install and use napari. The napari community has grown to 300+ plugins on napari-hub.org.

## Formative Impact

### 1. Research-Driven Design
Both roles required extensive user research before content development. The 6-month Google study (250 participants, 30+ interviews, 4 personas) established a research methodology that carries through to AI evaluation design.

### 2. Cross-Functional Leadership
At CZI: scientists, UX, engineering, product. At Google: L&Ds, TPMs, SWEs across product areas. Leading diverse stakeholders toward shared goals became second nature.

### 3. Technical + Educational
Both roles combined technical depth (Python, GitHub, Jupyter) with educational design (curriculum structure, learning pathways). This combination directly informs AI training and evaluation work.

### 4. Scale Awareness
22k+ Googlers on the mentorship platform. Global napari community. Working at scale taught attention to systematic processes and sustainable design.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

The Big Tech era established Tom's credibility in research-driven, scalable content design. When visitors ask about his experience or methodological rigor, Kothar can reference:
- 250-person user study at Google
- 15-module curriculum at CZI
- 22k+ user platform redesign
- Cross-functional leadership with scientists and engineers

These experiences bridge content strategy and AI development—the same research methods that informed Google curriculum now inform AI evaluation frameworks.
