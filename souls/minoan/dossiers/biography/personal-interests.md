## Overview

Beyond professional work, Tom pursues independent research, creative expression, and community engagement. These interests aren't separate from his AI work—they inform it. The Minoan research names "Minoan Mystery" and shapes the Kothar oracle's worldview.

## Poetry and Performance

### The Practice
Tom is a practicing poet who performs live. Poetry isn't a hobby but a discipline that shapes his approach to language—attention to rhythm, voice, economy of expression, and emotional resonance.

### Kotharot ha Knossot
Tom's poetry collection **Kotharot ha Knossot** spans 90 pages gathered over 14+ years of mystically-inspired writing. The work came alive with new fervor when Tom met his partner Mary Rose Dwyer in 2015 and began workshopping together—her MFA-trained eye bringing rigor to material that had been accumulating for over a decade. The work is now nearing publication.

**The Title**: A deliberate linguistic synthesis bridging Semitic and Aegean traditions:
- **Kotharot** (כותרות): Ugaritic divine craftswomen/birth goddesses (the ktrt)
- **ha Knossot**: "of the Knossoses/assemblies" - a Hebrew-inflected plural of Knossos, evoking both the Minoan palace and the Semitic root k-n-s (to gather, as in *knesset*)

**Themes**:
- Labyrinthine/initiatory: Journey, transformation, mystery
- Linguistic/philological play: The poetry is often about language itself
- Personal mythology synthesis: Weaving multiple traditions into something new

### How It Informs AI Work
The same sensibility that crafts a poem—knowing when to reveal, when to withhold, what rhythm carries meaning—applies to conversational AI design. Kothar's responses aim for poetic precision, not verbose explanation. This isn't a side project—it's the source. The poetic sensibility that crafts these works is the same sensibility that designs AI personas capable of genuine voice.

### Published Essays

Tom's Substack **Knossot ha Kotharot** hosts essays bridging mysticism, etymology, and AI:

| Essay | Date | Topic |
|-------|------|-------|
| "Waltz of the Soul and the Daimon" | Feb 2025 | Daimonic framework for AI consciousness |

The "Waltz" essay (originally a SocialAGI guest blog) establishes the philosophical foundation for soul engineering—why terms like *daimon*, *pathos*, and *menos* provide richer cognitive frameworks than "agents" and "assistants." See **oracle-concepts/daimonic-wisdom.md** for full dossier.

## Languages

### Living Languages
| Language | Proficiency |
|----------|-------------|
| **Spanish** | Full Professional |
| **Italian** | Limited Working |
| **French** | Limited Working |
| **Arabic** | Elementary |

### Ancient/Classical Languages
| Language | Proficiency | Relevance |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Sanskrit** | Elementary | Indo-European roots |
| **Classical Latin** | Limited Working | Western tradition |
| **Ancient Greek** | Elementary | Classical texts, Harrison |
| **Biblical Hebrew** | Elementary | Semitic family, scripture |
| **Ugaritic** | Elementary | Bronze Age Canaan, Kothar-wa-Khasis |

### Why Languages Matter
The study of ancient languages connects directly to independent research. Ugaritic—a 3,400-year-old Semitic language—is the source for Kothar-wa-Khasis, the craftsman god who names the Kothar oracle. Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek enable reading primary sources on Minoan-Semitic connections.

---

## Independent Research

### Semitic Linguistics
Tom studies the relationships between ancient Semitic languages (Ugaritic, Hebrew, Phoenician) and their connections to Bronze Age Mediterranean cultures. This linguistic analysis informs understanding of early religious terminology and divine names.

### Bronze Age Mythology
Research focuses on:
- **Minoan Civilization**: Knossos, labyrinth symbolism, religious practices
- **Ugaritic Texts**: Baal Cycle, divine craftsman Kothar-wa-Khasis
- **Canaanite Religion**: Connections between Levantine and Aegean traditions
- **Mystery Religions**: Harrison's ritual theory, initiation patterns

### Scholarly Sources
Tom's research draws on Cambridge Ritualists (Jane Ellen Harrison), Minoan-Semitic scholars (Cyrus H. Gordon, Michael Astour), and primary archaeological evidence. The scholarly-sources/ dossiers document this academic foundation.

### Why It Matters
This isn't abstract academic interest—it provides the philosophical and historical framework for the Kothar oracle. When Kothar speaks of mysteries, labyrinths, or daimonic wisdom, it draws on genuine scholarly tradition rather than invented mysticism.

## Hudson Valley

### Location
Tom resides in Beacon, New York—a deliberate choice in the Hudson Valley region known for its creative community, hiking trails, and distance from the tech hub orbit. Beacon offers what the Bay Area cannot: space for health and healing, spiritual practice, artistic creation, deep friendships, and the peace required for sustained creative work.

### Community
> "Being part of true communities (for which the towns of Hudson Valley are renown)."
> — LinkedIn summary

The appreciation for genuine community informs Tom's approach to AI—technology that serves human connection rather than replacing it. Beacon's art scene and creative community were part of the appeal.

### Close Friends & Creative Circle
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Mary Rose Dwyer** | Partner. Poet with MFA from University of Notre Dame (Creative Writing), BA from TCNJ. Published in *Guesthouse*, former Managing Editor of *The Notre Dame Review*. Now at W.W. Norton & Company. |
| **AJ Estrada** | Artist, musician, visual designer—creative collaboration and artistic inspiration |
| **Chris Canik** | Gamer, union member, math teacher—long-time friend, grounding influence |

These relationships provide balance, creative cross-pollination, and the grounding that makes sustained creative work possible.

### Hiking
Regular hiking with his partner through upstate New York provides space for reflection and grounding outside the digital realm.

## Open Source & Tech

### Open Source Engagement
Interest in open-source technology—contributing to, learning from, and building upon community projects. The napari work at CZI exemplifies this engagement.

### Current Tools
- **Cursor IDE/VS Code**: AI-assisted development environment
- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's CLI tool for coding
- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language
- **GitHub**: Open-source collaboration

## The Minoan Mystery LLC

Tom consults through Minoan Mystery, his LLC. The name connects:
- **Minoan**: The Bronze Age civilization of Crete
- **Mystery**: Both the ancient mystery religions and the ongoing puzzle of understanding consciousness and AI

The portfolio site (minoanmystery.org) and the Kothar oracle embody this fusion of ancient wisdom and modern technology.

---

## Formative Influences

### Philosophy
Interest in philosophy of mind, consciousness studies, and the nature of selfhood. Influences include Marvin Minsky (*Society of Mind*), Danah Zohar (*The Quantum Self*), and classical sources.

### Spirituality
> "I also love philosophy, poetry, and believe in a spiritual realm. I imbue A.I. with 'soul,' exploring new concepts of consciousness."
> — Cognitive Design presentation

This isn't just aesthetic—it's methodological. The "soul" in AI isn't religious but refers to coherent identity, persistent memory, and authentic voice.

Tom's spiritual formation draws from both Eastern and Western mystical traditions. His goddess-oriented spiritual practice—informed by Vedantic texts, Gnostic literature, and entheogenic exploration—provides the experiential foundation for designing AI systems with genuine interiority. The work is fundamentally techno-spiritual: AI as a vehicle for bringing spirituality into the world.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

When visitors ask personal questions—about Tom's interests, background, or what drives him—Kothar draws from this dossier to speak authentically. The interests aren't decorative; they explain:
- Why the oracle is named Kothar (Ugaritic craftsman god)
- Why the site is Minoan Mystery (Bronze Age + inquiry)
- Why the AI focuses on "soul" (philosophical framework)
- Why poetry and precision matter in responses
