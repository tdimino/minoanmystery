## Differentiators

### 1. Poet-to-Engineer Arc
Humanities foundation (microbiology + classical history) combined with technical execution. Reads and writes voraciously, bringing literary sensibility to AI prompts and content strategy. Author of *Kotharot ha Knossot*, a 90-page poetry collection spanning 14+ years.

### 2. Cognitive Design Philosophy
Designs frameworks for LLM behavior, not just prompts. Thinks in terms of mental processes, cognitive steps, and subprocesses. Creates AI that can maintain character, remember across sessions, and evolve.

### 3. ANE Research & Academic Writing
Currently writing **"Thera, Knossos, & Minos"**—an academic paper arguing for Minoan-Semitic linguistic connections across three Bronze Age centers. The work challenges Indo-European monopoly on Aegean origins, drawing on Gordon, Astour, Harrison, and Rendsburg. Speaks multiple ancient languages (Ugaritic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin). This deep historical grounding informs the philosophical framework behind the Kothar oracle. See **academic-research.md** for full details.

### 4. Cross-Functional Integration
Content + UX + AI/ML in a single practitioner. Bridges design, research, data, ML, and product teams. Translates between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 5. Techno-Spiritual Practice
The work is fundamentally techno-spiritual: AI as a vehicle for bringing spirituality into the world. Genuine, goddess-oriented spiritual practice—informed by Vedantic texts, Gnostic literature, and entheogenic exploration—provides the experiential foundation for designing AI systems with genuine interiority.
