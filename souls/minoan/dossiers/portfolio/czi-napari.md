## Project Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Client** | Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) |
| **Industry** | Nonprofit / Scientific Technology |
| **Duration** | 2021-2022 (8 months) |
| **Tom's Role** | Sr. Content Designer (Co-Lead) |
| **Team** | "Bravo Cohort" - 8 imaging scientists, UX researcher, PM, SWE |
| **Website** | https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/napari-segmentation-workshop/intro.html |

## Challenge

As part of its philanthropic charter, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was supporting the development of an open-source, Python-based image analysis tool called napari. Although it was free and lightweight on most computers, napari lacked the web presence and robust documentation it needed to gain wider adoption within the global scientific community.

CZI assembled a "Bravo Cohort" headed by myself and an application scientist to scope out and **build an onboarding platform for napari within 6 months**.

---

## Task

Hired as a Sr. Content Designer by CZI, my responsibilities also included those of a project manager, and later an instructional designer:

- Ingest hundreds of pages of UX research on napari, and establish a full 6-month project plan, with milestones and tentative deadlines.
- Audit the existing napari.org and napari-hub.org, and support 8 volunteer research scientists to conduct their own audits in tandem.
- Host multiple co-design workshops with research scientists, and synthesize these findings into a formal proposal for our project MVP.
- Design and build an iterative wiki-like onboarding platform for "non-coder" research biologists interested in adopting the napari tool.

As co-lead of the "Bravo Cohort", I plugged into the CZI Slack, partook in daily and weekly stand-ups, and bi-monthly napari community meetings. I acted as a mediator between our staff UX researcher, two application scientists, a product manager, and SWE on my team.

## Action

After vetting my 6-month project plan, I met with staff ML engineers at CZI to gain basic literacy in Python, install and use napari myself.

- While performing an audit of the napari sites and documentation, I added Issues/PRs on their GitHub to correct gaps in content for new users.
- I created expansive Mural boards intended to capture the expertise of our volunteer research scientists during our 2+ hour co-design workshops.
- I conducted competitive research of 12 other learning platforms (e.g. Data Camp and Kaggle) to analyze how they constructed UIs and curricula.
- We selected Jupyter Book as the ideal host for our project MVP, because of its transparency (hosted on GitHub) and ability to be iterated upon.

Building upon our co-design workshops, we assigned individual lessons from a larger "napari cell segmentation" course to our 8 volunteer research scientists. I forked a Jupyter Book template, modified it using Markdown, HTML and CSS, and acted as copy editor of all submitted lesson drafts.

## Results

Despite the bandwidth constraints of our 8 research scientists, we launched our napari learning platform with time to polish video content, and refine our UI.

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Course Modules** | 15 modules in "napari cell segmentation" course |
| **Workflows** | 3 complete workflows for new users to replicate |
| **Installation Guide** | Extensive Python installation documentation |
| **Plugin Ecosystem** | 300+ plugins on napari-hub.org |
| **Adoption** | Gaining adoption alongside Fiji and CellProfiler |

Biology PhDs at low-tech research labs (without expensive software) can now reliably install napari and apply it in the field of microscopy.

## Key Deliverables

- **Learning Platform**: Jupyter Book-based course on napari cell segmentation
- **15 Modules**: Complete curriculum with extensive Python installation guide
- **3 Workflows**: Practical workflows for new users to replicate
- **Co-Design Documentation**: Mural boards capturing scientist expertise
- **Competitive Analysis**: Research on 12 other learning platforms

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Project Management**: 6-month plan, milestones, cross-functional coordination
- **Instructional Design**: Curriculum development for technical audiences
- **Co-Design Facilitation**: Mural workshops with research scientists
- **Technical Writing**: Jupyter Book, Markdown, HTML/CSS
- **Open Source Contribution**: GitHub Issues/PRs
- **Cross-Functional Leadership**: Coordinating scientists, UX, and engineering

---

## Takeaways

On a small team operating under a tight deadline—with external variables beyond your control—**your project plan must be nimble and adaptable.** Milestones should help you reach consensus and gather feedback at critical stages. But in the face of the unforeseen, you have to **take charge and maintain morale** to deliver your MLP (minimal-*lovable*-product).

## Why This Matters for Kothar

When visitors ask about Tom's experience with open-source technology, scientific communities, or instructional design, Kothar can point to the napari project:
- Leadership of cross-functional teams (scientists, UX, engineering)
- Ability to learn technical domains (Python, microscopy, napari)
- Open source community engagement
- Delivering under tight deadlines with distributed teams
- The MLP philosophy—minimal *lovable* product
