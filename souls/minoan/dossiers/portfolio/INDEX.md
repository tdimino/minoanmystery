## Thematic Threads

### Thread 1: From Content to Cognitive
Each project builds on the last. Content strategy skills inform prompt engineering. UX research methods apply to LLM evaluation. Curriculum design shapes AI training approaches.

### Thread 2: Measurable Impact
Tom's work produces quantifiable results: revenue, adoption rates, time savings, user growth. Not vanity metrics—business outcomes.

### Thread 3: Cross-Functional Bridge
Every project involves translating between stakeholders: engineers and designers, data scientists and product managers, technical and non-technical audiences.

### Thread 4: Human-Centered AI
Whether it's AI for wealth advisors or soul-aware chatbots, the focus is on AI that serves human needs rather than replacing human judgment.

### Thread 5: Full-Stack AI
The Aldea work demonstrates depth across the entire AI stack: model training (LoRA fine-tuning), evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge), infrastructure (TensorRT-LLM, Triton), and application (Souls Engine).
