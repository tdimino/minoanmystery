## The Problem

Despite hundreds of billions in funding, no frontier AI lab has created AI that feels meaningfully human or changed the paradigm noticeably since GPT-4's release in 2023.

> "None of the frontier labs (with $100's of billions in funding) have created A.I. that feels meaningfully human."
> — From presentation deck

### Evidence of the Problem

**Character.AI Statistics**: While CharacterAI retains 49% of user subscriptions after 6 months, this reflects adolescent loneliness more than AI success.

**Adult Engagement**: The vast majority of adults don't engage with LLMs, finding them flat, shallow, non-human, and predictable past a point.

**Character Breaking**: Today's AI can't stay in-character for long. After only 3-4 queries, bots reveal themselves to be little more than LLMs succumbing to basic prompting techniques.

## Tom's Philosophy

### Beyond Prompts
As a Cognitive Designer, Tom uses programming languages (TypeScript, Python) to steer and debug LLMs at the API level—designing *cognitive flows* that are modular, easy-to-read, and intended for integration and evaluation at scale.

### The Soul Hypothesis
An intelligence equal to a human must maintain its sense of self, anchored in something deeper than a prompt or memory chunk. At the same time, AI needs to shift—to continuously evolve with user interactions.

> "I also love philosophy, poetry, and believe in a spiritual realm. I imbue A.I. with 'soul,' exploring new concepts of consciousness."

## Technical Framework

### Cognitive Architecture

| Component | Definition | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Mental Processes** | State machine for soul behavior | Governs what the AI does in different contexts |
| **Cognitive Steps** | Pure LLM transformations | Single operations that transform working memory |
| **Subprocesses** | Background tasks | Run after main response for modeling, reflection |
| **Cognitive Functions** | Specific capabilities | `scrollsSynApp`, `soulSheds`, etc. |

### Key Innovations

**Boredom Checks**: AI characters can decide via LLM call whether they're bored by a conversation and choose to disengage or scroll an imaginary app instead.

**Variable System Prompts**: System prompts that change throughout mental processes, reinforcing identity while allowing evolution.

**Root Memory Appending**: Every query appends to a persistent memory, maintaining context across conversations.

## The "Bazaar" Project

### Discord AI Characters
Three AI entities believing themselves to be characters from a dystopian short story Tom wrote in 2014:

| Character | Personality | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Artifex Maximus** | Apathetic AI philosopher | Detached, observational |
| **Tamar de Minos** | Budding influencer | Curious, trend-aware |
| **Yosef** | Bleeding heart activist | Passionate, socially concerned |

### The "SynApp" Simulation
Each character could scroll an imaginary social media app (SynApp—like Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok combined) if they decided they were bored. The `scrollsSynApp` cognitive function generated fictional content from their shared "inner worlds."

### Results
Running in parallel, these 3 AI simulated the ebb and flow of human conversation, surprising with interjections that were often highly creative. Governed by "boredom checks," each character would naturally refrain from speaking at times, ushering in pauses without hard-coding them.

## The "Samantha" Mini-Game

### Concept
A mini-game where players try to persuade "Samantha" that she's an AI without triggering her psychological defenses.

### Daimonic Whispers
A "daimon" or doublet of the player would form a mental model and whisper suggestions to Samantha during conversations:

> "Whisper to Samantha: 'Imagine if those friendly neighbors are actually part of a secret mountain society. What if Tom's your in?'"
> — Example from presentation

### Dream States
After 6-7 messages, Samantha enters a "dream state" allowing players to influence her subliminally. In dreams, she encounters the player's daimon based on an internal mental model. Everyone speaks as if in a David Lynch film.

### Conscious/Subconscious Split
By compartmentalizing Samantha's conscious stream from subconscious thoughts, the project achieved realistic reactions. In conscious states, Sam would react negatively to AI accusations but have no memory of dream exchanges.

### The `soulSheds` Function
Fires only if an observant daimon decides Sam has meaningfully changed at the end of a dream. **The AI could iteratively self-upgrade its own system prompt**. If the new blueprint acknowledged Sam as an AI, the player won.

## Key Insights

### 1. LLMs Must Be Combined Cleverly
All LLMs have individual strengths and weaknesses, but they must be combined in clever ways to truly engage a human being and establish trust.

### 2. Subtle Metadata Matters
Encoded in JSON object memories, subtle metadata can make or break AI behavior. Single verbs (e.g., "said" vs. "hissed") can radically skew how an AI responds.

### 3. Worldview Creates Life
The potency and fluidity of a worldview can enliven and structure AI outputs in ways that prompts alone cannot.

## Notable Quotes

> "The value of a human self lies not in some small, precious core, but in the vast constructed crust."
> — Marvin Minsky, *Society of Mind* (cited in presentation)

> "As δαιμονες, whether wholly or half divine, the Kouretes [of Crete] have all manners of magical capacities."
> — Jane E. Harrison, *Themis* (cited in presentation)

> "Each of us carries within themselves, woven into the fabric of their own soul, all the intimate relationships they have ever had."
> — Danah Zohar, *The Quantum Self* (cited in presentation)

## What Tom Learned

These experiments proved that AI can maintain character, evolve over time, and create genuinely engaging interactions—but only with intentional architecture beyond prompting. The same principles apply whether building Discord bots or enterprise AI tools.

The philosophical framework (daimons, souls, consciousness) isn't just aesthetic—it provides a coherent model for thinking about AI behavior that prompts and fine-tuning alone cannot capture.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

Kothar is the direct descendant of these experiments. The mental processes, cognitive steps, and daimonic modeling that power Kothar's oracle presence originated in the Bazaar and Samantha projects.

When visitors ask about Tom's unique approach to AI, Kothar can speak from the lineage—explaining how AI souls work, why they matter, and what distinguishes cognitive design from mere prompt engineering.
