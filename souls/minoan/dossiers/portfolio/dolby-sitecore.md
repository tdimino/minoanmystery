## Challenge

At the end of 2020, Dolby Labs had a bit of a problem. It had been years since their last redesign, and in that time they had amassed a CMS of **thousands of pages of complex, seemingly disparate content** they couldn't possibly update themselves. Within that collection, Dolby was maintaining what were effectively two separate websites: one for casual consumers, and one for technical folks.

Since the scale of this was beyond their scope, Dolby Labs recruited Valtech to re-organize and migrate **all of their domains** to the Sitecore engine.

---

## Task

As a consultant at Valtech, I became the Lead Content Strategist on the Dolby Labs re-design with a **2 week deadline** to:

- Audit the Dolby Labs consumer AND technical websites, and propose up to 12 page types to classify its thousands of web pages.
- Onboard to Sitecore's CMS, and familiarize myself with hundreds of design components built specifically for Dolby Labs by developers.
- Build interactive prototypes of the 12 proposed page types in Sitecore, and work with developers to modify components as needed.
- Pitch this vision for Dolby.com to their marketing leadership, gain their buy-in, and lay out a long-term plan for migrating to Sitecore.

Conferring with my product manager via Teams, I held daily stand-ups with her and our front-end engineering lead, ensuring I had access to the styling behind our design components, and approval for my creative direction.

## Action

With the relatively short timeframe allotted to me (in the middle of May 2020), I quickly executed on a few parallel workstreams:

- On a Zoom call with our engineering lead, I exported Dolby Labs' domain sitemaps from their proprietary CMS, including all available metadata.
- With the branching of Dolby's consumer and technical webpages clearly visualized for me, I discerned 10-12 buckets I could categorize them into.
- After winning approval for these 12 page "archetypes," I built them in the Sitecore CMS, experimenting with a full library of branded components.
- I created variations for each of these 12 templates, and annotated them from top-to-bottom for future copywriters and front-end devs to maintain.

Upon reaching a consensus internally, I worked tirelessly with our front-end devs to launch a fully-functional demo of these 12 page archetypes on Sitecore. As needed, I requested new components, or modified existing ones, to achieve our unified vision.

---

## Results

I pitched our set of 12 page templates, from cinematic landing pages to Dolby Atmos technical specs, and won approval from the Dolby Labs marketing team.

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Page Templates** | 12 annotated archetypes created |
| **Migration Timeline** | Thousands of pages migrated within 3 months |
| **Longevity** | Designs retained and applied for 4+ years |
| **Domain Expansion** | Enabled Dolby.io and Dolby Experiential launches |
| **Delivery Speed** | 2-week initial deadline met |

## Key Deliverables

- **12 Page Archetypes**: Annotated templates for all Dolby content types
- **Sitecore Prototypes**: Interactive demos in CMS
- **Content Audit**: Consumer + technical website analysis
- **Component Library**: Collaboration with devs on branded components
- **Migration Plan**: Long-term roadmap for Sitecore transition

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Information Architecture**: Classifying thousands of pages into 12 archetypes
- **CMS Expertise**: Sitecore platform, component library
- **Technical Content Strategy**: Dual-audience content (consumer + technical)
- **Rapid Execution**: 2-week deadline, parallel workstreams
- **Stakeholder Pitching**: Marketing leadership buy-in
- **Developer Collaboration**: Component modification requests

---

## Takeaways

Given the right vantage point, even an immense enterprise-grade ecosystem like Dolby Labs can be deconstructed. **Auditing under tight constraints forces you to look past the fluff** and see the function of a web page for what it is. Once you have a shared vision for a redesign, you can work wonders within a single sprint.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

When visitors ask about Tom's technical content strategy or enterprise experience, Kothar can point to Dolby:
- Ability to tackle massive legacy content ecosystems
- Speed and execution under tight deadlines (2 weeks)
- 4+ years of design longevity shows quality
- Dual-audience content strategy (consumer vs. technical)
- The "look past the fluff" philosophy for auditing
