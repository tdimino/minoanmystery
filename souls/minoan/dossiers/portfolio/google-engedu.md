## The Challenge

Google needed to upskill Googlers across the organization, helping them advance their soft and technical leadership skills. The engEDU organization was responsible for internal learning and development, but needed curriculum design expertise to create effective, engaging learning materials.

Additionally, Google's internal mentorship platform serving 22,000+ Googlers needed an audit and redesign to increase engagement and program launches.

## Tom's Approach

### Discovery
- Conducted a 6-month, skills-based user study involving 250 Googlers
- Distilled findings into 4 distinct learner personas
- Conducted interviews with 30+ L&Ds, TPMs, and SWEs across product areas
- Analyzed existing mentorship platform usage patterns

#### The 4 Learner Personas

| Persona | Learning Style |
|---------|---------------|
| **Big Thinker** | Conceptual, wants the big picture first |
| **Dabbler** | Exploratory, samples content opportunistically |
| **Digger** | Deep-dive, methodical and thorough |
| **Explorer** | Self-directed, connects across domains |

### Strategy
- Designed curriculum based on identified learner personas
- Developed frameworks for upskilling lessons
- Proposed mentorship platform improvements based on research
- Created templates for consistent learning material development

#### Five Elements of an Engaging Lesson

Framework developed for the TLE playbook:

1. **Hook** — Capture attention with relevance
2. **Context** — Establish why this matters
3. **Core Content** — The essential knowledge/skill
4. **Practice** — Active application
5. **Reflection** — Consolidate learning

### Execution
- Designed full curriculum of lessons coded in Markdown and HTML/CSS
- Audited and redesigned the internal Google mentorship platform
- Prototyped upskilling lessons with stakeholders
- Implemented improvements to increase program adoption

## What Tom Learned

The Google role demonstrated that curriculum design at scale requires deep user research. The persona-driven approach—understanding distinct learner types before designing content—informed Tom's later work on AI persona development and evaluation frameworks.

Working with technical audiences (L&Ds, TPMs, SWEs) across diverse product areas also developed skills in translating complex technical concepts for varied audiences.
