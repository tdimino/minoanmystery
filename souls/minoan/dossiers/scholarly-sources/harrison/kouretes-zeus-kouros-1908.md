# The Kouretes and Zeus Kouros: A Study in Pre-Historic Sociology (1908)

## Source

- **Type**: Journal Article
- **Title**: "The Kouretes and Zeus Kouros: A Study in Pre-Historic Sociology"
- **Author**: Jane Ellen Harrison
- **Published in**: *Annual of the British School at Athens*, Vol. XV (1908–1909)

## Overview

This article is Harrison's first major analysis of the Hymn to Diktaean Zeus discovered at Palaikastro, Crete. She argues that the mysteries of Zagreus-Dionysos—involving the dismemberment and resurrection of a divine child by "Titans" (white-clay-men)—are not inhuman cannibalistic rites but **tribal initiation ceremonies** analogous to those practiced by the Wiradthuri of Australia and countless other peoples worldwide. The Kouretes are not mythological beings but **initiated young men** who serve as παιδοτρόφοι (child-rearers) conducting initiates through death-and-rebirth rituals.

## The Opening Question

The article begins with the Hymn's startling invocation:

> "Ἰω, μέγιστε Κοῦρε, χαῖρέ μοι, Κρόνιε."
> "Greatest of Kouroi, I give thee hail, Kronian."

Harrison asks: "It may be that if we can understand the Kouretes, the gist of the Kouros will become clear. We begin, therefore, with the preliminary question: **Who were the Kouretes?**" (p. 308)

## Strabo's Four Characteristics

Harrison summarizes Strabo's analysis from Book X, identifying four key attributes of the Kouretes:

### I. Δαίμονες and Πρόπολοι (Divine Attendants)

> "The name Kouretes is applied by those who hand down Cretan and Phrygian traditions to certain beings, who are not merely young men but who are δαίμονες and also attendants (πρόπολοι) on the gods. This particular kind of Kouretes resembles Satyrs, Seilenoi, Bacchoi, and Tityroi." (p. 310)

**Related figures**: Korybantes, Idaean Daktyls, Telchines, Kabeiroi—"figures roughly analogous."

### II. Magicians, Μάντεις, and Metallurgists

> "The Korybantes bind and release men from spells, they induce madness and heal it." (p. 311)

The Kouretes are seers (μάντεις), metal-workers (smiths), and culture-heroes who invented the arts of civilization.

### III. Armed Ὀρχηστήρες (Dancers)

> "The most salient and also, to our minds, the most singular characteristic of these magical δαίμονες, these half-divine medicine men, these seers and metal-workers, is that they are armed and orgiastic dancers." (p. 311)

They "inspire terror by armed dances accompanied by noise and hubbub of timbrels and clashing arms and also by the sound of the flute and shouting."

### IV. Φύλακες and Παιδοτρόφοι (Guardians and Child-Rearers)

> "'In the Cretan discourses,' says Strabo, 'the Kouretes are called the nurses and guardians of Zeus.' And again in trying to explain the word Kouretes, he says they were so called either because they were young and boys or because of their rearing of Zeus." (p. 312)

## The Zagreus Mysteries

### Clement's Account

Harrison quotes Clement of Alexandria's description of the "utterly inhuman" mysteries:

> "The mysteries of Dionysos are utterly inhuman, for while he was still a child and the Kouretes were dancing round him their armed dance the Titans came stealthily upon him and lured him with childish toys and tore him limb from limb while he was yet a babe." (p. 313)

### Cardinal Elements

| Element | Greek Term | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Child-rearing | παιδοτροφία | Child tended by Kouretes who dance armed dance |
| 2. Death/Disappearance | ἀφανισμός, σπαραγμός | Child killed, dismembered by white-clay-men (Titans) |
| 3. Resurrection | ἀναβίωσις, παλιγγενεσία | Child reappears, comes back to life |
| 4. White-clay disguise | τίτανος → Τιτᾶνες | Men covered in gypsum (later mythologized as Titans) |
| 5. Thunder-Rites | βροντάς | Purification by thunder-stone, mimic thunder |

---

## The Euripides *Cretans* Fragment

Harrison draws on a crucial fragment from Euripides' lost play *Cretans*, describing Idaean Daktyls who come to purify Minos' palace:

> "I am set free, and named by name
> A Bacchos of the Mailèd Priests.
>
> Where midnight Zagreus roves, I rove,
> I have endured his thunder-cry;
> Fulfilled his red and bleeding feasts;
> Held the Great Mother's mountain-flame."

Harrison preserves the controversial reading **βροντάς** (thunders) against proposed emendations:

> "Light came from an unexpected quarter. In investigating thunderbolts I was referred to a passage, again, oddly enough, in Porphyry. Pythagoras, Porphyry tells us, in the course of his journey from Asia Minor to Italy came to Crete. There he met on landing some of the Mystae of Morgos one of the Idaean Daktyls, by whom he was initiated into their rites. The first rite he underwent at their hands was purification and this purification was effected by—**the thunderbolt or thunder-stone**." (p. 317)

---

## Thunder-Rites and the Bull-Roarer

### The Thunder-Stone (κεραυνία λίθος)

Harrison explains that celts (stone axes) were believed to be thunderbolts:

> "Such stones are called to-day by the modern Greek peasant 'lightning-axes' (ἀστροπελέκια). Great is their value as charms against thunder, *similia similibus*, to keep milk sweet, to cure rheumatism and the like." (p. 317)

### The Ῥόμβος (Bull-Roarer)

> "We know the very instrument with which in ancient days mimic thunder was manufactured, the famous Bull-roarer or ῥόμβος, the sound of whose whirring is mystical, awe-inspiring, and truly religious. It is like nothing in the world but itself, perhaps the nearest approach is the ominous sound of a rising storm-wind or angry imminent thunder." (p. 321)

Aeschylus describes the thunder-mimesis in the lost *Edoni*:

> "'And bull-voices roar thereto from somewhere out of the unseen, fearful semblances, and from a drum an image as it were of thunder underground is borne on the air heavy with dread.'" (p. 320)

## The Key Insight: Tribal Initiation

### The Wiradthuri Parallel

Harrison's breakthrough comes from anthropological comparison:

> "Light came to me unexpectedly from a paper kindly sent to me by Dr. Frazer containing an account of certain initiation ceremonies among the Wiradthuri tribes of New South Wales." (p. 322)

The account:

> "So Dhuramoolan pretended that he always killed the boys, cut them up, and burnt them to ashes, after which he moulded the ashes into human shape, and restored them to life as new beings." (p. 322)

Harrison's conclusion:

> "With the Cretan ritual in our minds it is clear that the Wiradthuri rites present more than an analogy; *mutato nomine* the account might have been written of Zagreus." (p. 323)

### The Titans as White-Clay-Men

> "The word Titanes (white-clay-men) comes of course from τῑτάνος, white earth or clay, gypsum. The Titanes, the white-clay-men, were later, regardless of quantity, mythologized into Titanes, Titans, giants." (p. 321)

> "The Titans then, the white-clay-men, are real men dressed up as bogeys to perform initiation rites. It is only later when their meaning is forgotten that they are explained as Titanes, mythological giants." (p. 322)

---

## The Meaning of Initiation

> "At and through his initiation the boy is brought into close communion with his tribal ancestors: he becomes socialized, part of the body politic. Henceforth he belongs to something bigger, more potent, more lasting, than his own individual existence: he is part of the stream of the totemic life, one with the generations before and yet to come." (p. 323)

> "So vital, so crucial is the change that the savage exhausts his imagination and his ingenuity in his emphasis of death and new birth. It is not enough to be killed, you must be torn to pieces or burnt to ashes. Above all you must utterly forget your past life." (p. 323)

## Notable Passages

> "The Kouretes at Messene had, Pausanias tells us, not a naos but a megaron." (p. 325)

— Context: The Kouretes' institution resembles the Men's House of tribal societies.

> "Pantomimic dancing is of the essence of each and every primitive mystery. To disclose the mysteries is as Lucian puts it 'to dance out the mysteries.' Instruction among savage peoples is always imparted more or less in mimetic dances." (p. 325)

— Context: Why Kouretes are ὀρχηστήρες (dancers).

> "Every single element, however seemingly preposterous, in both the ritual and myth of Zagreus can be explained I believe by the analogy of primitive rites of tribal initiation." (p. 322)

— Context: Harrison's central thesis.
