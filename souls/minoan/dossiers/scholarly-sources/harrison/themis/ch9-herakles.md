## Overview

This chapter traces Herakles as a transitional figure between daimon and Olympian, demonstrating that before Homer made him a heroic strong man, he was an Idaean Daktyl and fertility-daimon. Harrison shows that Herakles' "club" was originally a magical bough (κλάδος), his cornucopia the attribute of the Agathos Daimon, and his Twelve Labours the cycle of the Sun-Year. Though constantly being "received" into Olympos, Herakles never truly arrives—his positive functions as year-spirit and protector of epheboi forever bar the gates. The chapter culminates in the parallel figure of Asklepios, who similarly remained a healing daimon rather than becoming a true Olympian.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Herakles as Herm

Before saga humanized him, Herakles was a cult-pillar like Hermes:

> "Why should Hermes and Herakles be linked together? What has the young messenger with golden rod and winged sandals to do with the lusty athlete? A second question brings an answer to the first. What were Hermes and Herakles before 'Homer' made of one the 'servant of Zeus' and of the other the 'hero' of the labours? Pausanias himself tells us; they were both 'Herms.'" (p. 365)

The Athenians "zealous in all matters of religion, were 'the first to use the square-shaped images of Hermes.'" (Pausanias viii. 48.6)

### 2. The Club as Magical Bough

Harrison reveals the "club" as a fertility symbol:

> "We talk and write glibly of the 'club' of Herakles as his 'characteristic attribute' and thereby miss the real point. The 'club' of Herakles is not to begin with a thing characteristic of Herakles, a ῥόπαλον, the rude massive weapon of a half-barbarian hero; it is a magical bough, a κλάδος rent from a living tree." (p. 366)

**The Orphic Hymn preserves the original function:**
> "Come, Blessed One, bring spells for all diseases, / Drive out ill fates, wave in thy hand thy branch; / With magic shafts banish the noisome Keres." (p. 367)

**At Trozen** the club took root and became a tree again—the people "allege that Herakles placed his club against this image and this club, which was of wild olive, took root in the earth... and sprouted up afresh."

### 3. The Cornucopia and Acheloös

The cornucopia links Herakles to Agathos Daimon fertility cults:

> "The bough in the right hand tells then the same story of fertility as the cornucopia in the left.... Later when 'Homer' and his saga had completely humanized Herakles, when the saga-individuality of the hero became articulate and his functions as a daimon were forgotten, the cornucopia became cumbersome." (p. 368)

**Dejaneira's account of Acheloös reveals the fertility-daimon:**
> "A river was my lover, him I mean / Great Acheloös, and in threefold form / Wooed me, and wooed again. A visible bull / Sometimes, and sometimes a coiled, gleaming snake, / And sometimes partly man, a monstrous shape / Bull-fronted, and adown his shaggy beard / Fountains of clear spring water glistening flowed." (Soph. *Trach.* 9 ff.)

> "Nowhere perhaps does the fertility-daimon come so vividly before us.... We see him shifting from one familiar shape to another; he is now, like Agathos Daimon, like Zeus Ktesios, a 'gleaming snake,' now a 'visible bull.'" (p. 370)

### 4. Herakles as Sun-Year Daimon

The Twelve Labours encode a calendrical cycle:

> "Herakles is not only a seasonal fertility-daimon; he is manifestly a daimon of the Sun-Year. His Twelve Labours occupy a Great Year, μέγας ἐνιαυτός.... The sacrifice that, together with the death of Herakles on the pyre, crowned the great calendar festival, the Eniautos-festival, had a like symbolism. Twelve 'perfect bulls' stood for the twelve years, but in all the victims were a hundred, to save the face of the hundred moons in the octennial moon-cycle." (p. 372)

**The chorus of the *Trachiniae* appeals to Helios:**
> "'Thou whom Night as the stars die bringeth to birth / And layeth to bed all ablaze, / Helios, Helios, speak: where over the earth / Move his wandering ways?'... The real reason lies deeper; the Sun and only the Sun knows where Herakles is, for Herakles is a daimon of the Sun-Year." (p. 373)

### 5. Herakles as Idaean Daktyl

Harrison identifies Herakles with the Cretan magical brotherhood:

> "Herakles then, till saga caught and transformed him, was an Idaean Daktyl and as such own brother to the Kouretes, the Korybantes and the Satyrs. We wonder no longer that it was Herakles the eldest of the Idaean Daktyls who founded the Olympic games." (p. 377)

**At Mycalessos** the Idaean Herakles tends Demeter's sanctuary:
> "They say that it is closed every night and opened again by Herakles, who is said to be one of the so-called Idaean Daktyls. Here a miracle is exhibited. Before the feet of the image they place whatever fruits the earth bears in autumn and these keep the bloom upon them the whole year round." (Paus. ix. 19)

### 6. The Twofold Ritual

Herakles received both Olympic and chthonic offerings:

> "At Sikyon... 'Phaistos when he came to Sikyon found them devoting offerings (ἐναγίζοντας) to Herakles as to a hero. But Phaistos would do nothing of the kind but would offer burnt offering (θύειν) to him as to a god. And even now the Sikyonians, when they slay a lamb and burn the thighs upon the altar, eat a portion of the flesh as though it were a sacrificial victim, and another part of the flesh they devote (ἐναγίζονται) as though to a hero.'" (Paus. ii. 10. 3)

### 7. Herakles as Alexikakos of Epheboi

The wine-offering (οἰνιστήρια) links Herakles to youth initiation:

> "At Athens those who are about to become epheboi before the lock of hair is cut bring to Herakles a measure of wine and when they have poured libation they give to drink to those who come with them. And the libation is called οἰνιστήρια." (Hesychius)

> "To Herakles as to Hippolytos is offered the shorn lock, because he is the Greatest Kouros, Herakulos 'the young, dear hero.'" (p. 382)

### 8. Marriage to Hebe

The marriage has cultic significance:

> "Herakles the Ephelos, the Kouros, is fitly wedded to Hebe, maiden-youth in its first bloom, who is but the young form of Hera Teleia, the Kore." (p. 384)

## Asklepios and Telesphoros

Harrison extends the analysis to the healer-god:

> "Asklepios is a god but no Olympian; his art-type is modelled on that of Zeus; he is bearded, benign, venerable; he is, in fact, the Zeus of daimon-heroes. He never becomes an Olympian because he remains functional rather than personal, he is always the Saviour-Healer." (p. 385)

**Telesphoros** is the child-form of the Eniautos-daimon:
> "Asklepios, with his staff and venerable beard, represents Old Father Christmas, while Telesphoros embodies the Happy New Year. Under the influence of patriarchy and Zeus, the venerable type of the Eniautos-daimon prevails, and the Kouros form is largely forgotten." (p. 387)

## Notable Passages

> "On the very threshold of Olympos, one foot within the portals yet never quite inside, stands the hero of all heroes, the 'young dear hero,' Herakles. The reason of his tarrying there is simple and instructive. It is not that in his labours and his banquetings he is too human, too 'heroic' in the saga sense; it is that he is a daimon, and a daimon-hero has much ado to fit his positive functions and yet shadowy shape into the clear-cut inert crystal of the Olympian." (p. 364)

— Context: Why Herakles, despite constant "apotheosis," never becomes truly Olympian.

> "Herakles and Asklepios, though greater than any Olympians as Saviours and Healers, never became truly Olympianized. Their function highlights the thin and chill nature of the Olympian gods, who live in ease in the upper air, losing much when they shake off mortality and their feet leave the earth, their mother." (p. 388)

— Context: The daimonic origin is spiritually richer than Olympian abstraction.

> "We wonder no longer that it was Herakles the Idaean Daktyl who founded the Olympic games. It is not merely that there may have been early immigrants from Crete, it is certainly not because Herakles was the strong man of the Twelve Labours, it is because Herakles, the Idaean Daktyl, was as Megistos Kouros the fertility-daimon of the year." (p. 377)

— Context: Cretan origins of the Olympic Games through the Idaean Herakles.
