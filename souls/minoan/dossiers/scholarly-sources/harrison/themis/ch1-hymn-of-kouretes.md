## Overview

This chapter analyzes the Hymn to Diktaean Zeus discovered at Palaikastro in eastern Crete. Harrison argues that the hymn preserves in fossilized form the primitive ritual of tribal initiation. The "Kouros most Great" (*Megistos Kouros*) invoked by the Kouretes is not Zeus the Father but a year-spirit projected by the collective emotion of initiated young men. The Kouretes are not mythological attendants but real initiators who enact the death and rebirth of the tribal candidate.

## The Hymn Text

### Greek (Restored by Gilbert Murray)

```
Ἰω μέγιστε Κοῦρε χαῖρε μου,
Κρόνιε παγκρατέστανος ἱερὸς
Δαιμόνων ἁγημοσύναγω μενοσδίκτανες
ἐνιαυτῷ ἐρπε καὶ γαθίμολπα
τὰν τοικρέκομεν πάκτισμε δᾳ
τεσαμαυλοίσιν καὶ στάντε σε εἰς ἄδωμεν
εὐναμφὶ βῶμον ὑπερκήν.

Ἰω μέγιστε Κοῦρε χαῖρε μου,
πρέσβε δ' αὐτὰς ἔνθ' ὄρεσσι γῆς Κρήτης
ἔνθα τέ σ' ἐδέξανθ' ἱεραὶ Κουρῆτες
παῖδα μέγαν ῥέζων ἐκ μητρὸς ἑῆς
γῆς ἐνὶ κοίλῃ...

[gap in text]

Ἰω, κ.τ.λ.
[Τ]ῶρ' αἶδε βροτῶν κατ' ἔτος εὐθυντέρας
πάντα τ' ἄγρια γῆς καὶ ἐν ὄρεσιν τρέφει
εἰρήνη φιλέταιρος.

Ἰω, κ.τ.λ.
κᾶτε νεῶν πλεόντων καὶ πόλιος περικαλλέα
ἠδ' Θεμίδος καλῆς.
```

### Translation (Gilbert Murray)

> "Io, Kouros most Great, I give thee hail, Kronian, Lord of all that is wet and gleaming, thou art come at the head of thy Daimones. To Dikte for the Year, Oh, march, and rejoice in the dance and song,
>
> That we make to thee with harps and pipes mingled together, and sing as we come to a stand at thy well-fenced altar.
>
> Io, etc.
>
> For here the shielded Nurturers took thee, a child immortal, from Rhea, and with noise of beating feet hid thee away.
>
> Io, etc.
>
> [gap]... of fair dawn?
>
> Io, etc.
>
> And the Horai began to be fruitful year by year and Dikè to possess mankind, and all wild living things were held about by wealth-loving Peace.
>
> Io, etc.
>
> To us also leap for full jars, and leap for fleecy flocks, and leap for fields of fruit, and for hives to bring increase.
>
> Io, etc.
>
> Leap for our Cities, and leap for our sea-borne ships, and leap for our young citizens and for goodly Themis."

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Kouros is Not Zeus the Father

Harrison emphasizes the radical import of the opening words:

> "From the circumstances of the finding of the Hymn in the temple of Diktaean Zeus and from the title Kronian, it is clear that Zeus the Father of gods and men, is addressed as 'Kouros most Great,' greatest of grown-up youths. To our unaccustomed ears the title sounds strange and barely reverent." (p. 11)

**Critical distinction**: *Kouros* is not υἱός (son), nor is it παῖς (child). Kouros means "young man just come to maturity"—it connotes no relationship to a parent. The Kouros is the *projection* of the initiating group, not a divine infant.

### 2. The Kouros Has a Thiasos of Daimones

> "Nowhere save in this Hymn do we hear of Zeus with attendant daimones. He stands always alone, aloof, approached with awe, utterly delimited from his worshippers. One god only, Dionysos, and he but a half-bred Olympian, is attended by daimones... The Hymn brings us face to face with the fact that Zeus once had a thiasos, once when he was a young man, a Kouros." (p. 14)

The presence of the thiasos reveals the primitive structure: the god emerges from the group, not the group from the god.

### 3. Three-Part Structure of the Hymn

| Part | Content | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Invocation** | Μέγιστε Κοῦρε, χαῖρε μου, Κρόνιε | Commands the god to come—"come," "leap" |
| **Aetiological Myth** | "Here the shielded Nurturers took thee..." | Recounts the sacred story to be enacted |
| **Resultant Blessings** | "Leap for full jars... flocks... cities" | The magical effects of the rite |

> "The gist of the Hymn will not appear till all three factors have been examined in detail, but already, at the first superficial glance, we note certain characteristics of a Hymn of Invocation that may help to its understanding. The god invoked is not present, not there in a temple ready waiting to be worshipped; he is bidden to come, and apparently his coming, and as we shall later see his very existence, depends on the ritual that invokes him." (p. 8)

### 4. Ritual Precedes Myth (Dromenon → Legomenon)

> "This does not, however, imply, as is sometimes supposed, that ritual is prior to myth; they probably arose together. Ritual is the utterance of an emotion, a thing felt, in action, myth in words or thoughts. They arise pari passu. The myth is not at first aetiological, it does not arise to give a reason; it is representative, another form of utterance, of expression." (p. 16)

### 5. The Zagreus Mysteries as Initiation Rite

The Kouretes who dance over the infant in the hymn connect to the Zagreus mysteries, where Titans (white-clay-men) dismember a child who is then reborn:

**Cardinal elements:**
1. A child is taken from his mother and tended by men called Kouretes (παιδοτροφία)
2. The child is hidden, made away with, killed, dismembered (ἀφανισμός, σπαραγμός)
3. The child reappears, is brought to life again (ἀναβίωσις, παλιγγενεσία)

> "Every single element, however seemingly preposterous, in both the ritual and myth of Zagreus can be explained I believe by the analogy of primitive rites of tribal initiation." (p. 18)

### 6. The Wiradthuri Parallel

Harrison cites the initiation rites of the Wiradthuri tribe of New South Wales:

> "Dhuramoolan, a powerful being, whose voice sounded like the rumbling of distant thunder, had been charged by a still more powerful being called Baiamai, with the duty of taking the boys away into the bush and instructing them in all the laws, traditions, and customs of the community. So Dhuramoolan pretended that he always killed the boys, cut them up, and burnt them to ashes, after which he moulded the ashes into human shape, and restored them to life as new beings." (p. 22)

Harrison's conclusion:

> "With the Cretan ritual in our minds it is clear that the Wiradthuri rites present more than an analogy; mutato nomine the account might have been written of Zagreus." (p. 22)

### 7. The Dithyramb: Zeus-Leap-Song

Harrison etymologizes the Dithyramb—the choral hymn from which tragedy arose—as a "leap-song" connected to the Kouretes' ritual:

> "The word Dithyramb, Διθύραμβος, is, I believe, simply Δί-θύρ-αμβος, 'Zeus-leap-song.' The u in θύρ- for the more usual o of θόρ-, θρῴσκω, is due to northern Greek dialects which regularly show u for o." (p. 204)

**Etymology breakdown:**
| Component | Greek | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Δί- | Δι- | Zeus (genitive stem) |
| -θύρ- | θόρ-/θρῴσκω | leap, spring |
| -αμβος | ἀμβός | song, hymn |

The Kouretes "leap" (*θρῴσκουσι*) in their armed dance, just as the hymn commands the Kouros to "leap for full jars... leap for fleecy flocks." The Dithyramb was thus originally the magical song accompanying the spring-leap ritual that brought fertility.

### 8. The Korybantes and Conical Caps

Harrison connects the Kouretes to the Korybantes through their distinctive headgear:

> "The Korybantes are not really distinguishable from the Kouretes save in one particular—they wear the korybasia, the conical cap... This cap is at once the sign of the initiated and the means of initiation. The neophyte puts on the cap and becomes a Korybas." (p. 27)

**The korybasia (κορυβασία):**
- Conical felt cap worn by initiates
- Etymologically related to κορυβάντες (Korybantes)
- Symbol of transformation from boy to initiated man
- Depicted on Phrygian coins and Samothracian reliefs

The putting-on of the cap is a ritual death—the boy "disappears" under the cap and emerges as a new being, a Korybas.

### 9. The Women of Elis Hymn

Harrison provides a crucial parallel from mainland Greece—a hymn sung by the women of Elis invoking Dionysus in spring:

> "In Springtime, O Dionysos,
> To thy holy temple come,
> To Elis with thy Graces,
> Rushing with thy bull-foot, come,
> Noble Bull, Noble Bull."

**Structural parallels to the Palaikastro Hymn:**
| Element | Kouretes Hymn | Women of Elis Hymn |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Invocation** | "Io, Kouros most Great, come!" | "To thy holy temple come" |
| **Season** | "For the Year" (ἐνιαυτῷ) | "In Springtime" |
| **Animal form** | (Bull implicit in leaping) | "Bull-foot... Noble Bull" |
| **Attendants** | "At the head of thy Daimones" | "With thy Graces" |
| **Magical intent** | Fertility, increase | (Spring renewal) |

> "The Elis hymn shows that the invocation of an incoming god is not peculiar to Crete; it belongs to the Spring ritual of the Eniautos-Daimon wherever found. The god is bidden to come because he is not yet there—he is born anew each year." (p. 32)

## Notable Passages

> "The word Kouretes is simply a specialized derivative of Kouros... It is, like Kouros, a word impossible to translate, because we have lost the social condition expressed. Young Men (Kouroi) we know, but Initiated Young Men (Kouretes) are gone for ever." (p. 24)

— Context: Harrison explains why these Greek terms resist translation—we lack the social institution they name.

> "At and through his initiation the boy is brought into close communion with his tribal ancestors: he becomes socialized, part of the body politic. Henceforth he belongs to something bigger, more potent, more lasting, than his own individual existence: he is part of the stream of the totemic life, one with the generations before and yet to come." (p. 23)

— Context: The meaning of initiation—social rebirth, not merely ceremonial marking.

> "So vital, so crucial is the change that the savage exhausts his imagination and his ingenuity in his emphasis of death and new birth. It is not enough to be killed, you must be torn to pieces or burnt to ashes. Above all you must utterly forget your past life." (p. 23)

— Context: Why the death symbolism in initiation is so emphatic.

## Archaeological Context

**Discovery**: The hymn was found at Palaikastro, eastern Crete, in excavations by the British School at Athens (1902–1905). Three main fragments were recovered from near a temple of Diktaean Zeus.

**Dating**: The stele was engraved in the 2nd–3rd century AD (cursive letters), but the poem itself dates to approximately 300 BC. Two copies exist on front and back of the same stone—suggesting the stone-mason found the material unfamiliar.

**Significance**: Palaikastro preserved archaic customs that had died out at Knossos. As Strabo noted, "when the warlike cities, and especially Knossos, were ravaged, certain customs were kept up among the inhabitants of Lyttos and Gortyna and other lesser towns rather than by the Knossians."
