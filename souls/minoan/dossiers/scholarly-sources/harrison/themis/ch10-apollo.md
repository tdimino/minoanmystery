## Overview

This chapter completes Harrison's analysis of the transition from daimon to Olympian by examining Apollo—the one who "successfully" made the passage. Harrison demonstrates that Apollo as Aguieus was originally a fertility-cone like the omphalos, that the Python-slaying myth arose from the ritual death of the snake-king at the enneateric Stepterion, and that Apollo as Phoibos inherited the attributes of moon and sun. Most significantly, the chapter establishes what it means to be an "Olympian": the systematic negation of the Eniautos-daimon's characteristics—shedding animal form, repudiating earth-connection, refusing to die and be reborn.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Apollo Aguieus as Fertility-Cone

The street-god was originally an omphalos-like pillar:

> "Aguieus is a pillar tapering to the end, which they set up before the doors. And some say they are proper to Apollo, others to Dionysos, others to both." (Harpocration)

Harrison explains: "The pillar was neither Apollo nor Dionysos, it preceded and entered into the nature of both." (p. 418)

**At Ambrakia** the cone appears on coins:
> "The filleted obelisk on the coins of Ambrakia is the symbol and vehicle of a god thrice familiar, Apollo Aguieus, 'He of the Ways.'" (p. 419)

### 2. The Omphalos as Grave-Mound

Harrison establishes the omphalos's true nature:

> "Varro provides a crucial tradition: the omphalos at Delphi is the tumulus of Python, a sacred snake. The omphalos is thus a grave-mound marked by a holy stone, combining elements of tomb and tombstone." (p. 421)

**Evidence from beehive tombs:**
> "The 'Tomb of Tantalos' on Mt. Sipylos features a terminal cone like the Delphic omphalos, symbolizing life and reincarnation." (p. 422)

### 3. The Enneateric Festivals

Harrison analyzes three nine-year festivals at Delphi:

> "There are three Nine-Year Festivals that the Delphians keep in the following order. One they call Stepterion, the next Herois, the third Charila." (Plutarch, *Greek Questions*)

| Festival | Meaning | Ritual |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Stepterion** | "Festival of Wreathers" | Attack on king's hut, flight to Tempe, return with laurel |
| **Herois** | "Bringing up of Semele" | Thyiades' mystery, resurrection of earth |
| **Charila** | Famine-expulsion | Puppet beaten and buried, then exhumed |

### 4. The Stepterion and Python

There was no snake in the ritual—only a king's palace:

> "Clearly Plutarch has here no belief in the aetiological myth.... The Stepterion consisted of a secret attack with lighted torches on a hut, which though apparently it is made of wood or reeds had somehow—a piece of purple drapery and a wreath would do it—the semblance of a king's palace." (p. 426)

**The snake-king origin:**
> "There was a snake at Delphi probably painted on the omphalos, and, it may be, a real snake used for divination.... The king as hero-daimon is envisaged as a snake. Cecrops was a snake, Kychreus was a snake. The old snake dies, the young snake lives." (p. 432)

### 5. The Daphnephoria

The ritual pole encodes the sequence from Earth to Heaven:

> "They wreathe a pole of olive wood with laurel and various flowers. On the top is fitted a bronze globe, from which they suspend smaller ones. Midway round the pole they place a lesser globe binding it with purple fillets.... By the topmost globe they mean the sun to which they actually compare Apollo. The globe beneath this is the moon." (Proklos)

Harrison concludes: "We have an Eiresione of the Earth, the flowers of the Earth.... We have the Moon with her purple fillets half-way up the pole, and at the top the saffron-decked globe of the golden Sun Phoibos himself. The ladder from Earth to Heaven is complete." (p. 436)

### 6. Apollo as Megistos Kouros

The name Apollon derives from the ephebic assembly:

> "The word ἀπελλαζέως is, Hesychius tells us, Laconian for ἐκκλησιάζειν.... Most significant of all Hesychius has the gloss ἀπελλακᾶς· ἐστιν ἐφήβων κοινωνία." (p. 437)

> "The ἀπελλαία I believe to be the offerings made at puberty initiation. Apellaios is the month of these rites and these offerings, Apellon is the projection of these rites; he, like Dionysos, like Herakles, is the arch-ephebos, the Megistos Kouros." (p. 438)

### 7. What It Means to Be an Olympian

Harrison identifies three "negative" characteristics:

**1. Sheds plant and animal form:**
> "In art this exclusion of animal and plant life from the cycle of the divine is sometimes claimed as a gain. Rather it leaves a sense of chill and loneliness." (p. 446)

**2. Refuses to be an Earth-daimon:**
> "When the human-shaped Olympians triumph they [the snake-daimones] become evil monsters to be overthrown. Their kingdom is of this earth." (p. 448)

**3. Refuses to be a daimon of air and sky:**
> "The Titans cannot be very precisely delimited from the Giants. They too are in some sense Earth-born.... But, and this is the interesting point, the Titans, unlike the Giants, seem early to have left their earth-nature behind them and climbed one step up the ladder to heaven." (p. 452)

### 8. The Olympian as Negation

> "The complete human-nature god is, roughly speaking, what we call an Olympian. What then are his characteristics? It will be seen in the sequel that they are strangely, significantly negative, that an Olympian is in fact in the main the negation of an Eniautos-daimon." (p. 444)

## The Cult Sequence at Delphi

| Stage | Divinity | Nature | Form |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Gaia | Earth | Omphalos, Python |
| 2 | Themis | Dream-oracle | Chasm, vapours |
| 3 | Phoibe | Moon | Night-time divination |
| 4 | Phoibos | Sun | Day-time clarity |
| — | Zeus | Father of all | Claims Apollo speaks his will |

From the *Eumenides*:
> "First in my prayer before all other gods / I call on Earth, primaeval prophetess. / Next Themis on her mother's mantic throne / Sat, so men say. Third by unforced consent / Another Titan, daughter too of earth, / Phoibe possessed it. She for birthday gift / Gave it to Phoibos, and he took her name." (p. 417)

## Apollo vs. Dionysos

| Aspect | Apollo | Dionysos |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Celestial** | Sun, day, order | Moon, night, dreams |
| **Mode** | Segregation from nature | Communion with nature |
| **Life stage** | Human accomplishment | Life-force itself |
| **At Delphi** | Newcomer, takes over | Earlier claimant |
| **Form** | Humanized completely | Retains animal/plant shapes |
| **Death** | Does not die | Dies and rises |

> "Apollo has more in him of the Sun and the day, of order and light and reason, Dionysos more of the Earth and the Moon, of the divinity of Night and Dreams. Moreover, Apollo is of man's life, separate from the rest of nature, a purely human accomplishment; Dionysos is of man's life as one with nature, a communion not a segregation." (p. 441)

## Notable Passages

> "The Greek Gods, in their triumphant humanity, kicked down that ladder from earth to heaven by which they rose. They reflected, they represented the mood of their worshippers, which tended always to focus itself rather on what was proper to humanity than on what was common to man and the rest of the universe." (p. 444)

— Context: The cost of becoming fully human-shaped gods.

> "It is well to look at things from the other side, the side set before us in the *Prometheus* of Æschylus. Prometheus is the arch-Titan and he is son of Gaia.... There is perhaps nothing in all ancient poetry more lovely than the coming of the Okeanid chorus." (p. 454)

— Context: The old nature-powers have their own beauty.

> "Apollo was Phoibos of the unshorn hair, and now remembering his double Herakles Alexikakos we understand why.... He-of-the-Unshorn-Hair is youth incarnate, youth just about to be initiated." (p. 439)

— Context: Apollo as arch-ephebos.
