# Chapter XI: Themis

## Source

## Overview

This culminating chapter defines Themis as the projection of the collective conscience—not merely abstract justice but the social imperative itself, the "stuff of which religious representations are made." Harrison demonstrates that Themis hovers "on the very verge of godhead" as the force that binds men together, preceding the particular shapes of gods. Using Durkheim's sociology, she argues that religion consists of obligatory beliefs connected to definite practices—and that this obligation derives solely from the social conscience. The chapter traces the shift from matrilinear to patrilinear structure, showing how Zeus, Apollo, and Athena form a patriarchal trinity (Phratrioi) while the older figures (Kronos, Gaia, the Kouretes) preserve matrilinear patterns.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Themis as Social Imperative

Harrison's central thesis—Themis is the collective conscience personified:

> "Themis is the force that brings and binds men together, she is 'herd instinct,' the collective conscience, the social sanction. She is *fas*, the social imperative. This social imperative is among a primitive group diffuse, vague, inchoate, yet absolutely binding." (p. 485)

**Etymology reveals function:**
> "The Greek word Themis and the English word Doom are, philology tells us, one and the same.... Doom is the thing set, fixed, settled; it begins in convention, the stress of public opinion; it ends in statutory judgment.... **Themis like Doom begins on earth and ends in heaven.**" (p. 482)

### 2. Themis Not Quite a God

Themis precedes and underlies all gods but never becomes fully divine:

> "In a word Themis is not religion, she is the stuff of which religious representations are made. That is why in the ordered sequence of the gods at Delphi we gave Themis no place. She is the substratum of each and every god, she is in a sense above as well as below each and every god, but herself never quite a full-fledged divinity." (p. 489)

**Homer shows her hovering on divinity:**
> "Patroklos comes to the place where was their assembly and their *themis*, whereby also were the altars of their gods established.... The social fact is trembling on the very verge of godhead." (p. 485)

### 3. Durkheim's Definition of Religion

Harrison adopts Durkheim's sociological definition:

> "Les phénomènes dits religieux consistent en croyances obligatoires connexes de pratiques définies qui se rapportent à des objets donnés dans les croyances." (p. 490)

**The key insight:**
> "It is the emphasis and representation of herd instinct, of the collective conscience, that constitutes religion." (p. 485)

Religion vs. morality vs. art:
> "Morality is the social conscience made imperative upon our actions, but morality unlike religion, save on questions involving conduct, leaves our thoughts free. Art, which is also, like religion, a representation of the social conscience, has no incumbencies. She imposes no obligation on either action or thought. Her goddess is Peitho not Themis." (p. 491)

### 4. The Cyclopes as Athemistoi

The barbarian condition is lack of Themis:

> "That is what is wrong with the Cyclopes: they reverence the gods, they are earth-worshippers, and earth for them brings forth her increase, but they are *ἀθέμιστες*, they have no customs, no conventions, binding by common consent, they have no *agora*. That for the Greek was the last desolation." (p. 483)

**Homer's portrait:**
> "Κυκλώπων δ' ἐς γαῖαν ὑπερφιάλων, ἀθεμίστων, ἱκόμεθ'.....τοῖσι δ' οὕτ' ἀγοραὶ βουληφόρου οὔτε θέμιστες." (p. 483)

### 5. Themis and the Agora

Themis's function in Homer is to convene and dissolve assemblies:

> "Why, we ask, with Hermes and Iris at hand, ready to speed over earth and sea with messages and mandates, should Themis have to execute just this one office of convening the assembly?... She is no herald like Hermes, no messenger like Iris, she is the very spirit of the assembly incarnate. Themis and the actual concrete *agora* are barely distinguishable." (p. 484)

### 6. Matrilinear Social Structure

The older religion reflected matrilinear society:

> "Mother, Child, Initiated youths, these are the factors of the old social group. The father, Kronos, is...nowhere.... The myth is a presentation, a projection of the days when, at first, the facts of fatherhood were unknown, and later, but little emphasized." (p. 504)

**Woman as social centre:**
> "It is important to note that this primitive form of society is matrilinear not matriarchal. Woman is the social centre not the dominant force.... In primitive matrilinear societies woman is the great social force or rather central focus, not as woman, or at least not as sex, but as mother, the mother of tribesmen to be. This social fact finds its projection in the first of divine figures, in *Kourotrophos*—'Rearer of Sons.'" (p. 505)

### 7. The Patriarchal Trinity: Zeus, Apollo, Athena

The Olympian family reflects patrilinear conquest:

> "This alliance of the three Olympians of the Eumenides, Zeus, Apollo, Athena, brings us to a curious point. The bond, we feel, is non-natural; the three gods stand together not because there is any primitive link, any common cultus, but as projections, representations of patriarchy, pushed to the utmost. They are a trinity of *Phratrioï*, *Putrōoï*." (p. 513)

**Apollo's argument in the *Eumenides*:**
> "The mother is no parent of her 'child,' / Only the nurse of the young seed within her. / The male is parent, she as outside friend / Cherishes the plant, if fate allows its bloom." (p. 513)

### 8. Dike as Cosmic Order

Dike differs from Themis in extending to all nature:

> "We speak of the δίκη of a wolf, a foal, a torrent, not of its θέμις; but man, as well as nature, has his ways, his habits, so we speak of the δίκη of men.... *Dike* then is the way of the world, the way things happen, and *Themis* is that specialized way for human beings which is sanctioned by the collective conscience, by herd instinct." (p. 523)

**Dike as universal course:**
> "In one passage at least, in the *Medea* of Euripides Dike stands for the course, even the circular course of the whole cosmos. In the general reversal of all things: 'Upward go the streams of the living rivers, Dike and all things are turned about.'" (p. 525)

## The Hybristika and Rites de Passage

Harrison analyzes the festival of gender-reversal:

> "The name τὰ ὑβρίστικα means things outrageous, insolent in the etymological sense, things against use and wont. Now why, in a primitive society, should *Themis* who rules over all things be wantonly and yet systematically outraged?" (p. 508)

**The solution:**
> "The rites of puberty, the rites of marriage, are, like all other primitive rites, *rites de passage*: their object is to afford a safe passage in the perilous transit from one age or condition to another.... When he passes to manhood, he ceases to be a woman-thing and begins to exercise functions other and alien." (p. 509)

### Van Gennep's Three-Phase Structure

Harrison explicitly adopts Arnold van Gennep's terminology from *Les Rites de Passage* (1909):

> "Van Gennep has shown that the rites de passage fall into three stages: rites of separation (préliminaires), rites of transition (liminaires), and rites of incorporation (postliminaires). The initiate must die to his old status, pass through a liminal state of suspension, and be reborn to his new condition." (p. 510)

**The three phases in Greek rites:**
| Phase | Name | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Préliminaire** (Separation) | Death of old status | Seclusion from women; departure from mother |
| **Liminaire** (Transition) | Liminal suspension | Gender reversal; silence; darkness |
| **Postliminaire** (Incorporation) | Rebirth to new status | Crowning; new name; return to society |

### The Liminal State

The liminal or transitional phase is characterized by reversal of ordinary rules:

> "In the liminal state, the ordinary rules of Themis are suspended. The initiate is neither boy nor man, neither alive nor dead. He may wear women's clothes, or go naked, or be smeared with clay. He is a-social, extra-social, until the rite of incorporation restores him to the social order—but in a new place." (p. 511)

**Liminal characteristics in Greek rites:**
| Rite | Liminal Feature | Meaning |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Krypteia (Sparta) | Youth lives wild, like a wolf | Beyond social law |
| Arkteia (Brauron) | Girls "become bears" | Temporary wildness |
| Oschophoria | Youths dress as women | Gender boundary dissolved |
| Argive Hybristika | Women wear men's clothes | Social reversal |

### Death and Rebirth

The initiatory death is not metaphor but social reality:

> "The death is real in this sense—the boy, the child of his mother, really dies. He is killed, torn to pieces, burnt to ashes, forgotten; and he who rises again is a man and a tribesman. He has been made into something other than he was." (p. 512)

**The death-rebirth pattern:**
1. **Seclusion** - Removal from mother and women
2. **Ordeal** - Pain, terror, mutilation (circumcision, scarification)
3. **Instruction** - Sacred knowledge revealed
4. **New name** - Old identity abandoned
5. **Return** - Re-entry as adult male

> "The severity of initiation rites is not mere cruelty or superstition. It is a religious necessity. The old self must be utterly destroyed that the new self may be born. The greater the transformation required, the more drastic the ritual death." (p. 513)

## The Oracle of Trophonios

Harrison connects oracular rites to initiation:

> "The same *daimones* preside over oracles and over rites of initiation; *Trophoniads*, *Idaean Daktyls* and those of the age of *Kronos* are all substantially the same." (Plutarch, cited p. 517)

**Lethe and Mnemosyne:**
> "*Lethe* is but an attenuated Death; *Mnemosyne*, renewed consciousness, is a new Life." (p. 518)

> "Plato's whole scheme alike of education and philosophy is but an attempted rationalization of the primitive mysticism of initiation, and most of all of that profound and perennial mysticism of the central *rite de passage*, the death and the new birth, social, moral, intellectual." (p. 520)

## Notable Passages

> "Religion has in it then two elements, social custom, the collective conscience, and the emphasis and representation of that collective conscience. It has in a word within it two factors indissolubly linked: ritual, that is custom, collective action, and myth or theology, the representation of the collective emotion, the collective conscience. And—a point of supreme importance—both are incumbent, binding, and interdependent." (p. 491)

— Context: The dual nature of religion as practice and representation.

> "The notion of the divinity, far from being what is fundamental in religious life, is in reality but a secondary episode. It is the product of a special process by which one or two of the religious characteristics concentrate and take concrete shape in the form of a more or less defined individuality." (Durkheim, cited p. 494)

— Context: Gods emerge from sanctity, not the reverse.

> "And first did the *Moirai* lead Heavenly *Themis* of the Good Counsels with golden horses along the springs of *Okeanos*, up the holy ladder of *Olympos*, along the shining way. She who was of earth, she who was Earth herself, leaves her home and goes the way of all things divine, up to *Olympos*. But, in the very pomp and pageant of her going, we feel she is entering on an alien kingdom." (Pindar, cited p. 527)

— Context: Themis's "translation" to heaven is artificial—she belongs to earth.

> "For all men rose again from the earth remembering nothing of their past. And such things as private property and families did not exist, but Earth herself gave them abundance of fruits from trees and other green things, spontaneously, and not through husbandry." (Plato, *Politicus*, cited p. 507)

— Context: The Age of Kronos preserved matrilinear, communal structure.
