# Introduction to Themis

## Overview

The Introduction to *Themis* sets out Harrison's philosophical framework—her debt to Henri Bergson's concept of *durée* (life-force) and Émile Durkheim's sociology of collective representation. She explains why the mystery-god Dionysos, attended by his *thiasos*, embodies authentic religion (life), while the Olympians—intellectualized, individualized, beautiful but static—are religiously dead. The Hymn of the Kouretes discovered at Palaikastro provides the "natural and necessary plot" for the book.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Olympians as "Cut Flowers"

Harrison's famous metaphor for the Olympian gods:

> "The Olympian gods—that is, the anthropomorphic gods of Homer and Pheidias and the mythographers—seemed to me like a bouquet of cut-flowers whose bloom is brief, because they have been severed from their roots. To find those roots we must burrow deep into a lower stratum of thought, into those chthonic cults which underlay their life and from which sprang all their brilliant blossoming." (p. i)

### 2. The Debt to Bergson: Durée

Harrison's first philosophical debt—to Bergson's *L'Évolution Créatrice* (1907):

> "I saw in a word that Dionysos, with every other mystery-god, was an instinctive attempt to express what Professor Bergson calls *durée*, that life which is one, indivisible and yet ceaselessly changing. I saw on the other hand that the Olympians, amid all their atmosphere of romance and all their redeeming vices, were really creations of what Professor William James called 'monarchical deism.' Such deities are not an instinctive expression, but a late and conscious representation, a work of analysis, of reflection and intelligence." (p. ii)

### 3. The Debt to Durkheim: Collective Representation

Harrison's second debt—to Durkheim's sociological theory:

> "The mystery-god arises out of those instincts, emotions, desires which attend and express life; but these emotions, desires, instincts, in so far as they are religious, are at the outset rather of a group than of individual consciousness. The whole history of epistemology is the history of the evolution of clear, individual, rational thought, out of the haze of collective and sometimes contradictory representations." (p. iii)

**Corollary**: "The form taken by the divinity reflects the social structure of the group to which the divinity belongs. Dionysos is the Son of his Mother because he issues from a matrilinear-group."

### 4. The Two Principles

Harrison distills her framework to two principles:

> "These two ideas, (1) that the mystery-god and the Olympian express respectively, the one *durée*, life, and the other the action of conscious intelligence which reflects on and analyses life, and (2) that, among primitive peoples, religion reflects collective feeling and collective thinking, underlie my whole argument and were indeed the cause and impulse of my book." (p. iii–iv)

### 5. The Hymn of the Kouretes as Plot

The Palaikastro hymn provides the book's structure:

> "In commenting on this Hymn, discovered in the temple of Diktaean Zeus, I found to my delight that we had in it a text that embodied this very group-thinking, or rather group-emotion towards life, which I had begun to see must underlie all primitive religious representations. The Hymn sung by the Kouretes invoked a *daimon*, the greatest Kouros, who was clearly the projection of a *thiasos* of his worshippers." (p. iv)

## Mystery Religion vs. Olympian

| Aspect | Mystery Religion (Dionysos) | Olympian Religion (Zeus, Apollo) |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Represents** | *Durée*—life as indivisible, changing | Reflection, analysis, intellect |
| **Mode** | Instinctive expression | Conscious representation |
| **Social form** | Thiasos (group) | Individual worship |
| **Form of god** | Mutable (bull, snake, tree) | Fixed, human, beautiful |
| **Relation to death** | Dies and is reborn | Immortal, cannot die |
| **Religious value** | Authentic | Religiously dead |

## Chapter Summaries (Harrison's Own)

Harrison provides a detailed synopsis of each chapter:

### Chapter I: The Hymn of the Kouretes
The Kouretes represent initiated young men of a matrilinear group. The *Daimon* they invoke is the Greatest Kouros, springing from the rite of initiation—a *dromenon* of New Birth into the tribe.

### Chapter II: The Dithyramb, the Dromenon and the Drama
The *dromenon* is "a thing re-done, or pre-done with magical intent." The Dithyramb, origin of drama, was also a *dromenon* of New Birth.

### Chapters III-V: Thunder-Rites, Magic, Omophagia
Sanctities (mana, tabu) precede divinities. "Le sacré c'est le père du dieu." The Omophagia (eating raw flesh) is a communal, sacramental feast understood through totemism.

### Chapter VI: The Spring Festival and Hagia Triada
The seasonal *dromenon* at spring brings new life for man, animals, and plants. The Dithyramb is the Spring-Song of the Year-Festival.

### Chapter VII: The Olympic Games (Cornford)
The Games arose from a race of the Kouretes. The victor becomes the *Eniautos-Daimon*, the year-spirit incarnating the group's luck.

### Chapter VIII: Daimon and Hero
The hero is not a historical great man but "a dead ancestor performing his due functions"—a functionary wearing the mask of an Eniautos-Daimon.

### Chapters IX-X: From Daimon to Olympian
Herakles failed to become Olympian because he remained an Eniautos-Daimon. Apollo succeeded. The Olympians shed their animal forms—"loss as well as gain."

### Chapter XI: Themis
Above all gods stands Themis—"social ordinance, the collective conscience projected, the Law or Custom that is Right."

## The Eniautos-Daimon: A New Term

Harrison explains her coinage:

> "I am well aware that no such conjunction as *Eniautos-Daimon* exists in Greek. I did not set out to invent any such word, nor did I even foresee its employment; it simply grew on my hands from sheer necessity.... I prefer 'Eniautos' to 'year' because to us 'year' means something definitely chronological, a precise segment as it were of spatialized time; whereas *Eniautos*, as contrasted with *etos*, means a period in the etymological sense, a cycle of waxing and waning." (p. vii)

## On Religion and Dogma

Harrison's personal confession:

> "But, profoundly as I also feel the value of the religious impulse, so keenly do I feel the danger and almost necessary disaster of each and every creed and dogma. For the material of religion is essentially the uncharted, the ungrasped.... Further, every religious dogma errs in two ways. First, it is a confident statement about something unknown and therefore practically always untrustworthy; secondly, if it were right and based on real knowledge, then its subject-matter would no longer belong to the realm of religion; it would belong to science or philosophy." (p. xii)

## Notable Passages

> "Primitive religion was not, as I had drifted into thinking, a tissue of errors leading to mistaken conduct; rather it was a web of practices emphasizing particular parts of life, issuing necessarily in representations and ultimately dying out into abstract conceptions." (p. ii)

— Context: Harrison's shift from intellectualist to practice-based view of religion.

> "Broadly speaking, these Olympians represent that tendency in thought which is towards reflection, differentiation, clearness, while the Eniautos-Daimon represents that other tendency in religion towards emotion, union, indivisibility. It might almost be said that the Olympians stand for articulate consciousness, the Eniautos-Daimon for the sub-conscious." (p. x)

— Context: The psychological contrast between the two religious types.
