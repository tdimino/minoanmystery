# Chapter II: The Dithyramb, the Dromenon and the Drama

## Source

- **Type**: Book Chapter
- **From**: *Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion*
- **Author**: Jane Ellen Harrison (1850–1928)
- **Date**: 1912
- **Pages**: 30–49
- **Citation**: Harrison, J.E. (1912). *Themis*. Cambridge University Press, Chapter II.

## Overview

This chapter develops Harrison's theory that ritual action (*dromenon*) precedes and generates both myth (*legomenon*) and drama. The Greek dithyramb—the choral song to Dionysos from which tragedy arose—was originally a spring *dromenon*, a magical rite of renewal. Harrison traces the psychological and linguistic origins of the *dromenon* concept and argues that drama inherits its essential forms from seasonal fertility ritual.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Dromenon Defined

Harrison's foundational definition:

> "A *dromenon* is, literally, 'a thing done,' but the word has a shade of meaning that our word 'deed' has lost. By *dromenon* the Greeks meant not only a thing done but a thing re-done, or pre-done; a thing enacted or represented. It is sometimes translated 'ritual,' but *dromenon* goes to the very heart of ritual while 'ritual' is apt to emphasize the outer shell." (p. 35)

**Key distinction**: A *dromenon* is not mere action—it is action with **magical intent**, either commemorative (re-enacting the past) or anticipatory (pre-enacting the desired future).

### 2. Ritual Precedes Myth

Harrison argues against the view that myths generate rituals:

> "This does not, however, imply, as is sometimes supposed, that ritual is prior to myth; they probably arose together. Ritual is the utterance of an emotion, a thing felt, in action, myth in words or thoughts. They arise *pari passu*. The myth is not at first aetiological, it does not arise to give a reason; it is representative, another form of utterance, of expression." (p. 16)

**The relationship**:
- τὰ δρώμενα = things done (ritual action)
- τὰ ἐπὶ τοῖς δρωμένοις λεγόμενα = things said upon the things done (accompanying words)

### 3. From Dromenon to Drama

The dithyramb marks the transition:

> "The Dithyramb was then a *dromenon*, 'a thing done' in relation to a *daimon*, a fertility spirit, and that fertility spirit was in the first instance the group itself. When the group—or if the group be already individualized, the representative of the group—did the Dithyramb, it did its own life-history, it enacted the *palingenesia* or New Birth." (p. 45)

**Three stages:**
1. Collective dance with undifferentiated participants
2. Emergence of a leader (*exarchos*) who stands apart
3. Dialogue between leader and chorus → birth of drama

### 4. The Psychology of Mimesis

Harrison draws on contemporary psychology:

> "Pantomimic dancing is of the essence of each and every primitive mystery. To disclose the mysteries is, as Lucian puts it, 'to dance out the mysteries.' Instruction among savage peoples is always imparted more or less in mimetic dances." (p. 42)

Mimesis is not mere imitation but **participatory identification**—the dancer *becomes* what he enacts.

## Notable Passages

> "Drama, like the Dithyramb out of which it came, was in its origin and essence the enactment, the *dromenon*, of a god; its representation was in ritual movement what the myth told in words. Drama lived its life in and through the cult of Dionysos because Dionysos, unlike the other Olympians, was himself in origin a *dromenon*, a thing annually enacted, the New Birth, the year-spirit incarnate." (p. 48)

— Context: Why drama belonged to Dionysos specifically, not to any other god.

> "The primitive mind is not occupied in asking 'why?' It is too busy dancing and singing to ask questions. The *dromenon* is not an attempt to explain anything, it is simply a rite, a thing done, done for the good of the tribe, done because it always has been done, done with immediate magical intent." (p. 38)

— Context: Against intellectualist theories that see ritual as "primitive science."
