## Overview

*Themis* extends Harrison's earlier *Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion* (1903) by applying Bergsonian philosophy and Durkheimian sociology to Greek religion. The central argument: Greek religion arose from collective ritual (*dromenon*), not from individual belief or literary invention. The Hymn of the Kouretes discovered at Palaikastro provides the key text—a fossilized fragment of primitive religion showing how the collective emotion of initiated young men projects the figure of a *daimon* (year-spirit).

The book traces the evolution from primitive ritual through *daimones* to Olympian gods, arguing that the mystery religions (Dionysos, Orphism) preserved the original religious impulse while the Olympians became intellectualized abstractions—beautiful but spiritually dead.

> "The Olympian gods—that is, the anthropomorphic gods of Homer and Pheidias and the mythographers—seemed to me like a bouquet of cut-flowers whose bloom is brief, because they have been severed from their roots." (Introduction)

## Key Arguments

### 1. Ritual Precedes Myth (Introduction, Ch. I-II)

The *dromenon* ("thing done") is prior to the *legomenon* ("thing said"). Myths are not primitive science or allegory but verbal accompaniments to ritual actions. The Kouretes do not merely tell stories about Zeus—they enact his birth through armed dance.

### 2. The Collective Projects the Daimon (Ch. I, VII)

The *daimon* is not a god but a projection of collective emotion. When the Kouretes dance, their group consciousness creates the "Greatest Kouros" (*Megistos Kouros*). The god is the thiasos, and the thiasos is the god.

### 3. The Eniautos-Daimon (Ch. VII-VIII)

The year-spirit (*Eniautos-Daimon*) embodies the cycle of death and renewal. The Olympic victor becomes the Eniautos-Daimon incarnate—not an individual champion but a functionary representing the group's luck for the year.

### 4. Mystery vs. Olympian (Introduction, Ch. IX-X)

Mystery religions (Dionysos, Orphism) preserve *durée*—the Bergsonian life-force. Participants become one with the god through sacramental communion. Olympians, by contrast, are intellectualized, fixed in beautiful human form, incapable of death and therefore of life.

### 5. Themis as Social Conscience (Ch. XI)

Above the gods stands Themis—the collective conscience projected, the Law that is Right. She is not a goddess but the social structure itself divinized. The Olympians are patrilinear; the mystery religions reflect an earlier matrilinear structure.

## Philosophical Framework

### Henri Bergson (1859–1941)

Harrison draws on Bergson's concept of *durée* (lived time, life-force) from *L'Évolution Créatrice* (1907). Mystery religions express *durée*—they are participatory, life-affirming, continuous. Olympians represent intellectualized, spatialized time—frozen snapshots extracted from the flow of life.

### Émile Durkheim (1858–1917)

From Durkheim's *Les Formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse* (1912) and earlier papers, Harrison takes the concept of collective representation. Religious ideas arise from group consciousness, not individual inspiration. The form a divinity takes reflects the social structure of its worshippers.
