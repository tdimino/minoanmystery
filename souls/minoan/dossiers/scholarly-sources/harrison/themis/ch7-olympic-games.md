## Overview

This chapter, contributed by Francis Macdonald Cornford, introduces the crucial concept of the **Eniautos-Daimon** (year-spirit) and argues that the Olympic Games originated not as funeral games for a dead chieftain (the Euhemeristic view of Ridgeway), but as a **New Year's festival**—the inauguration of a "Year" (*eniautos*). The Olympic victor does not merely commemorate a dead hero; he *becomes* the Eniautos-Daimon, the fertility-spirit of his year, embodying the community's luck and life-force.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Against the Funeral Theory

Cornford rejects the prevailing view that the Games originated as funeral rites for Pelops:

> "It thus appears that the funeral theory, which would have the whole Olympic festival originate in the obsequies of an actual man called Pelops, is contradicted by the more ancient traditions of Elis and unsupported by any monumental evidence. The field is clear for an alternative theory which will take account of the fact that the Games were believed to be older than the time of Pelops." (p. 245)

**Key evidence against funeral origin:**
- No grave of Pelops found at excavations—only a neolithic baby
- Ancient tradition traces Games to before Pelops
- The "dead" at other panhellenic games were not chieftains (Archemoros was an infant, Glaukos a sea-daimon, and at Pytho, a snake)
- Hero-sacrifices at Pelops' precinct were annual, but Games were penteteric

### 2. The Games as New Year Festival

Cornford proposes that the Games reflect a **Saturnalian** or **Kronian** festival—a ritual of the dying year defeated by the vigorous new year:

> "According to the view which we shall put forward, the Games are to be regarded as originally and essentially a New Year's festival—the inauguration of a 'Year.' If it can be shown that the legends can be interpreted as reflecting rites appropriate to such a festival, the hypothesis will have some claim to acceptance." (p. 247)

### 3. The Eniautos-Daimon Concept

The central theoretical innovation—the *Eniautos-Daimon* (year-spirit):

> "We may think of the temporary 'king' as actually being the eniautos-daimon or fertility spirit of his 'year.' When the year is fixed by the solar period, we get festivals of the type of the Roman Saturnalia or the Greek Κρόνια... and the single combat appears as the driving out of winter or of the dying year by the vigorous young spirit of the New Year that is to come. It is as eniautos-daimon, not at first as 'incarnate god' or as king in the later political sense, that the representative of the fertility powers of nature dies at the hands of the New Year." (p. 259)

The term *eniautos* denotes:
- A lunar or solar year
- A longer period: 2, 4, or 8 years (trieteris, penteteris, enneateris)

### 4. Two Factors in the Pelops-Oinomaos Myth

Cornford disentangles two separable elements:

| Factor | Content | Ritual Meaning |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **(a) Single Combat** | Young king defeats old king | Death of old year, succession of new year-daimon |
| **(b) Marriage Flight** | Bride carried off in chariot | Sacred marriage of Sun and Moon |

> "It is obvious that this story does not describe a primitive form of mere sport. It is made up of at least two distinct factors. (a) There is, first, the contest between the young and the old king, ending in the death of the elder and the succession of the younger to the kingdom. (b) Second, there is the carrying off (ἁπαγή) of the bride." (p. 249)

### 5. The Olympic Victor as Incarnate Daimon

The victor was treated with divine honors:

> "The Olympic victor... was treated with honours both regal and divine; feasted in the prytaneum; crowned with a spray of olive like the wreath of Zeus himself; pelted, like a tree-spirit or Jack-in-the-Green, with leaves... Finally, on his return to his native city, the victor was dressed in royal purple and drawn by white horses through a breach in the walls. In many cases he was worshipped after death, as a hero; not because he was a successful athlete, but because he had once been an incarnate god." (p. 251)

### 6. The Foot-Race of the Kouretes (Elean Tradition)

The Elean tradition traces the Games to a foot-race of Cretan Kouretes:

> "With regard to the Olympic games, the Elean antiquaries say that Kronos first reigned in Heaven, and that a temple was made for him by the men of that age, who were named the Golden Race; that when Zeus was born, Rhea committed the safe-keeping of the child to the Idaean Daktyls or Kouretes, as they are also called; that the Daktyls came from Ida in Crete, and their names were Herakles, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Jasios, and Idas; and that in sport Herakles, the eldest, set his brethren to run a race, and crowned the victor with a branch of wild olive." (p. 271)

**Conclusion**: "The race, we may suppose, determined who should be the Kouros—the Greatest Kouros—of his year."

## The Heraea: Women's Games

The women's games (Heraea) preceded the men's games and belong to the older lunar calendar:

> "The Heraea, then, were probably older than the reconstituted Olympia; and if they gave its name to the month Parthenios, they must have been annual before they were octennial or penteteric. They carry us back to the old lunar year, which preceded the combined sun-and-moon penteteris." (p. 266)

**Key points:**
- Run by the Sixteen Women who wove a robe for Hera
- Virgins raced in order of age (youngest first)
- Victor received olive crown and portion of sacrificed cow
- Associated with Hera Parthenos (virgin Hera renewed after sacred marriage)

---

## Sacred Marriage: Sun and Moon

Dr. Frazer's interpretation, accepted by Cornford:

> "The union of the full moon and the full-grown Sun is one form—the astronomical—of that sacred marriage which in many parts of the ancient world was celebrated at midsummer. This union, we suggest, is symbolised by the marriage of Pelops and Hippodameia... He gives reason for holding that 'under the names of Zeus and Hera the pair of Olympic victors'... 'would seem to have really personated the sun and moon, who were the true heavenly bridegroom and bride of the ancient octennial festival'." (p. 262)

**Evidence:**
- Twelve rounds of chariot-race = Sun through twelve signs
- Hippodameia = "Horse-tamer" = Moon who rides her horse
- Endymion's fifty daughters = fifty moon months of penteteris
- At stadium starting point: tomb of Endymion (sinking Sun who married Selene)

## Ritual Elements

### The Single Combat

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Participants** | Old king (Oinomaos) vs. young challenger (Pelops) |
| **Outcome** | Old king killed; young king succeeds |
| **Meaning** | Old year defeated by new year |
| **Parallel** | Rex Nemorensis at Nemi (Golden Bough) |
| **Evidence** | Plutarch: single combat at Pisa "which ended only with the slaughter and death of the vanquished" |

### The Weather-King

Oinomaos as weather-magician:

> "Oinomaos, whom legend made both husband and son of Sterope, the lightning-flash, was one of those weather-kings... who claimed to control the powers of the sky and to call down its rain and thunder by virtue of his own mana." (p. 250)

**Sacred tree complex:**
- Phorbas dwelt under oak, challenged pilgrims, hung heads on tree
- At Olympia: wooden pillar (Oinomaos' palace) survived lightning strike
- Altar of Zeus Keraunios (Thunderbolt Zeus) at the spot

## Kouretes and Sosipolis at Olympia

Cornford identifies a complex of ancient shrines at the foot of the Hill of Kronos:

| Shrine | Deity | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Metroon | Mother Goddess | Very ancient cult |
| Altar of Kouretes | Kouretes | Attendants of infant Zeus |
| Shrine of Eileithyia-Sosipolis | Mother and Infant | The Idaean Cave counterpart |

> "So we find among the most ancient monuments of the Altis a complex of shrines dedicated to the Mother and Child, and the attendant Kouretes—a group whose significance has already been made clear. It represents the three essential factors of a matrilinear society." (p. 275)

**Sosipolis** ("Saviour of the City"):
- Infant god worshipped in cave-shrine
- Manifested as snake
- Fed honey-cakes by aged priestess
- Represents the Eniautos-Daimon in infant form

## Notable Passages

> "We shall be on safer ground if we restrict ourselves to the simple primitive group, consisting of the weather-magician who wields the fertilising influences of Heaven, and the tree which embodies the powers of the Earth—the vegetation which springs up when the thunder shower has burst, and Heaven and Earth are married in the life-giving rain." (p. 250)

— Context: Cornford cautions against over-theological interpretation; the primitive pattern is weather-magic + sacred tree.

> "Magic—the magic which immediately controls the food-supply and the natural phenomena on which it depends—was carried on before there were any gods at all, and can be carried on by direct mimetic methods, without any prayerful appeals to dead ancestors." (p. 247)

— Context: Magic precedes religion; *dromenon* precedes prayer.

## Scholarly Context

### Against Professor Ridgeway

Cornford specifically refutes W. Ridgeway's funeral theory:

> "'A great principle,' he says, 'is involved in this discussion, since the evidence shows that whereas it is commonly held that the phenomena of vegetation spirits and totemism are primary, they are rather to be regarded as secondary phenomena arising from the great primary principle of the belief in the existence of the soul after death, and the desirability of honouring it.'" (p. 246)

Cornford's response: "Of the extreme view stated in the last sentence the whole of this book may be taken as a refutation."

### Builds On

- **A.B. Cook** - Zeus as sky-god; weather-king hypothesis
- **J.G. Frazer** - Rex Nemorensis; sacred marriage; Saturnalia
- **Gilbert Murray** - Octennial cycle analysis

### Calendar Theory

The octennial period (*enneateris*) reconciles lunar and solar years:
- 8 solar years ≈ 99 lunar months
- Games alternated between months Apollonios and Parthenios
- 49-month and 50-month intervals
