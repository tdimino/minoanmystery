## Overview

This chapter analyzes the spring *dromenon* as the prototype of Greek religious festival, using the famous Hagia Triada sarcophagos from Crete as primary evidence. Harrison argues that the paintings on the sarcophagos depict not a mere funeral but a seasonal renewal rite—the death and resurrection of the year-spirit. The chapter establishes the connection between Minoan cult practice and later Greek religion, showing how the Dithyramb preserves the structure of this archaic spring ceremony.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Hagia Triada Sarcophagos

Harrison analyzes this Late Minoan limestone coffin discovered in 1903:

> "The famous sarcophagos of Hagia Triada presents us, I believe, with a picture of actual Cretan ritual, ritual very closely analogous to, and probably ancestral to, the *dromenon* out of which arose the Dithyramb." (p. 159)

**The scenes depicted:**
1. **Bull sacrifice** - Animal tied to table, blood dripping into vessel
2. **Offerings to the dead** - Figures carrying offerings toward a building
3. **Tree and bird** - Sacred tree with bird perched upon it
4. **Standing figure** - Youth before a building (the *heroon*)
5. **Double axes** - Surmounted by birds throughout
6. **Musicians** - Lyre player and flute player

### 2. The Sacred Marriage of Earth and Sky

The sarcophagos depicts the *hieros gamos*:

> "The wedlock of Earth and Sky is the central mystery of the spring festival. The bull-sacrifice is the means by which the worshippers participate in this cosmic union. The blood poured out is the rain of heaven fertilizing the earth." (p. 178)

**Symbolic elements:**
- Double axe = thunder symbol
- Bird on axe = sky-spirit
- Bull = earth-power
- Blood = rain

### 3. The Cuckoo as Spring-Bird

Harrison identifies the bird on the double axe:

> "The cuckoo is, for the Greeks, the bird *par excellence* of the spring, of the sacred marriage. Zeus wooed Hera in the form of a cuckoo. The cuckoo's first song announces the season of ploughing and sowing." (p. 185)

The Hagia Triada bird is likely the cuckoo, marking the scene as a spring festival.

### 4. The Standing Figure as Eniautos-Daimon

The mysterious standing figure before the building:

> "He is certainly I think a *kouros* like in youth and strength to the *kouroi* who approach him with offerings, only stiff and somewhat xoanon-like as becomes one who is a daimon not a man... Near him is his holy tree, sign and symbol of the life and function of an *Agathos Daimon*." (p. 195)

This figure is **not** a particular dead man but the **collective ancestor**, the year-spirit receiving seasonal offerings.

## The Hagia Triada Ritual Sequence

| Panel | Scene | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **A1** | Bull on table, blood dripping | Sacrifice to release life-force |
| **A2** | Woman at altar, double axes with birds | Invocation of sky-powers |
| **A3** | Procession with offerings | Tribute to the daimon |
| **B1** | Lyre player, woman with vessel | Musical accompaniment, libation |
| **B2** | Standing figure before building | The Eniautos-Daimon at his heroon |
| **B3** | Tree, bird, boat | Sacred tree, spring-bird, new-moon vessel |

## The Double Axe Complex

| Element | Greek | Significance |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Double axe | λάβρυς | Thunder-weapon; Minoan sacred symbol |
| Pillar-base | — | Earth-altar receiving blood |
| Bird | κόκκυξ? | Sky-spirit; spring herald |
| Blood | αἷμα | Rain of heaven; life-force |

Harrison links the Minoan *labrys* to the Cretan Labyrinth:

> "The Labyrinth is the House of the Labrys, the double axe. It is no maze but a palace-sanctuary where the thunder-god was worshipped." (p. 188)

## Notable Passages

> "The sarcophagos is not the record of an individual funeral. It is, I believe, the picture of a seasonal ritual, a spring *dromenon*, enacted year by year for the renewal of life. The 'dead man' is not one particular chieftain—he is the collective dead, the ancestors, the year-spirit who dies and rises again." (p. 165)

— Context: Against the view that the sarcophagos depicts an actual funeral.

> "In the mimic drama of the Dithyramb we have the death of bird and tree—the old year—and their resurrection as new bird, new tree—the new year. The worshippers are themselves the dying and rising god." (p. 198)

— Context: The participatory nature of the spring dromenon.

> "The bull-sacrifice on the Hagia Triada sarcophagos is not a gift to a god. It is the slaying of the divine animal itself that its life-blood, its *mana*, may pass into the earth and into the worshippers." (p. 175)

— Context: Sacramental vs. gift theory of sacrifice.
