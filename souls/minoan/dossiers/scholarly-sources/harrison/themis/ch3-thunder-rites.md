## Overview

This chapter examines the thunder-rites practiced by the Kouretes and Idaean Daktyls, using the Euripides *Cretans* fragment as primary evidence. Harrison argues that the mystic "accomplished the Thunders" (βροντὰς τελέσας) through three ritual acts: purification by thunder-stone, hearing mimic thunder from the bull-roarer, and beholding the thunderbolt on a throne. The chapter establishes that sanctity (*mana*) precedes divinity—the thunderbolt was worshipped before Zeus existed to wield it.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Euripides *Cretans* Fragment

Harrison analyzes a crucial passage preserved by Porphyry describing the initiation of a Bacchos:

> "There in one pure stream / My days have run, the servant I / Initiate of Idaean Jove; / Where midnight Zagreus roves, I rove. / I have endured his thunder-cry, / Fulfilled his red and bleeding feasts; / Held the Great Mother's mountain flame; / Enhallowed I and named by name / A Bacchos of the Mailed Priests." (p. 97)

**Key ritual elements:**
1. Thunder-cry (βροντάς) of night-wandering Zagreus
2. Feasts of Raw Flesh (ὠμοφαγία)
3. Mountain torches of the Great Mother
4. New name: "Bacchos"

### 2. The Thunder-Stone (κεραυνία λίθος)

Harrison explains how Pythagoras was initiated by the Idaean Daktyls:

> "Pythagoras, Porphyry tells us, in the course of his journey from Asia Minor to Italy came to Crete. There he met on landing some of the Mystae of Morgos, one of the Idaean Daktyls, by whom he was initiated into their rites. The first rite he underwent at their hands was purification, and this purification was effected by—the thunderbolt or thunder-stone." (p. 102)

The thunder-stone is a prehistoric celt (stone axe) mistaken for a thunderbolt:

> "Such stones are called to-day by the modern Greek peasant 'lightning-axes' (ἀστροπελέκια). Great is their value as charms against thunder, *similia similibus*, to keep milk sweet, to cure rheumatism and the like." (p. 102)

### 3. The Bull-Roarer (ῥόμβος)

Harrison identifies the instrument of mimic thunder:

> "We know the very instrument with which in ancient days mimic thunder was manufactured, the famous Bull-roarer or ῥόμβος, the sound of whose whirring is mystical, awe-inspiring, and truly religious. It is like nothing in the world but itself, perhaps the nearest approach is the ominous sound of a rising storm-wind or angry imminent thunder." (p. 107)

The scholiast on Clement describes it: "a bit of wood to which a string is tied, and it is whirled round and round at initiation-rites to make a whirring sound."

### 4. The Thunderbolt on the Throne

Harrison argues that the initiate beheld not Zeus but the thunderbolt itself:

> "The thunderbolt was to the primitive Greek not the symbol or attribute of the god, but itself the divine thing, the embodiment and vehicle of the god. As such, long after Zeus had taken on full human form in literature, it held its place in cultus, not as a weapon in the hand of the human god, but actually occupying his throne." (p. 105)

Evidence from coins of Seleukeia Pieria shows "a large thunderbolt with fillet attached, lying on a cushion on a throne."

### 5. Accomplishing the Thunders

The complete ritual sequence:

> "In the mysteries of Zagreus, then, as practised by the Kouretes and Idaean Daktyls, the initiated man (1) was purified by a thunderbolt, (2) heard mimic thunder, (3) probably beheld a thunderbolt on a throne. After these experiences, he may, I think, fairly be said to have 'accomplished the Thunders.'" (p. 108)

## The Child and the Thunder-Stone

Harrison traces the mythological identity of Zeus and the thunder-stone:

> "Hesiod knew it, at least subconsciously. When Kronos was about to swallow Zeus, what is it that Rhea gives him and that he really swallowed? A stone in swaddling clothes.... Long before Zeus was Zeus, thunder and lightning were, in a sense to be considered presently, divine potencies, their vehicle was a thunder-stone." (p. 106)

On the Hagia Triada terracotta relief: "We have seen three dancing Kouretes or Korybantes who clash their shields over the infant Zeus. Near him, lying on the ground, is a thunderbolt, his vehicle, his equivalent rather than his attribute."

## Notable Passages

> "The rites we are about to examine are then not rites of simple tribal initiation, but rather rites of initiation practised by the Kouretes in perhaps a later stage of their development as a magical fraternity. The Kouretes are now well on their way to become daimones; they will presently become actual gods (θεοί), as in Hesiod." (p. 98)

— Context: The Kouretes have specialized from general initiators to a magical fraternity.

> "The word Titanes (white-clay-men) comes of course from τῑτάνος, white earth or clay, gypsum. The Titanes, the white-clay-men, were later, regardless of quantity, mythologized into Titanes, Titans, giants." (p. 95)

— Context: Etymology of Titans as initiators, not mythological beings.

> "The Greeks, says a Christian Father, worship (θεραπεύουσι) the thunderbolt. The statement causes us something of a shock.... All he states is that they 'worshipped' the thunderbolt, that is, had a cult of it, tended it, attended to it, made it the object of 'religious' care." (p. 109)

— Context: Worship of the thunderbolt precedes worship of Zeus.

## The Open Rites of Knossos (Diodorus, via Harrison)

Harrison draws on Diodorus of Sicily to establish that Cretan mysteries were uniquely accessible:

> "The rite of initiation, which is perhaps the most celebrated of all, is that which is performed by the Athenian at Eleusis."

Yet at Knossos, the pattern was inverted:

> "At Knossos the custom was the rites should be open to all. Things that among others were communicated in secrecy, the Cretans concealed from no one who wished to know."

This openness distinguishes the Cretan mysteries from the exclusive Eleusinian model that later dominated Greek religion.

---

## The Meaning of "Mystery" (Harrison, *Prolegomena* 1903)

Harrison redefines the term "mystery"—not secrecy but ceremony of purification:

> "The usual derivation of the word is from μύω, I close the apertures whether of eyes or mouth."

But this misses the ritual meaning:

> "A Mystery is a rite, a drama, enacted with magical intent. Mystery is the doing of what relates to a μύσος—a pollution. Primarily, it is a ceremony of purification."

The Greek word for initiation (*τελετή*) likewise reveals the true nature of the rite:

> "The Greek word for initiation (τελετη) tells its own tale—it means not entering in, but completion, accomplishment, fulfilment."
