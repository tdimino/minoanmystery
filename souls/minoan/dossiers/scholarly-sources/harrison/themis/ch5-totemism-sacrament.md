# Chapter V: Totemism, Sacrament and Sacrifice

## Source

## Overview

This chapter argues that the *omophagia* (eating of raw flesh) central to Bacchic initiation can only be understood through totemism—the felt unity between a human group and its animal or plant kin. Harrison contends that totemism is not a particular social structure but a stage in epistemology, a way of thinking prior to differentiation between subject and object, human and animal. Sacrifice and sacrament are both forms of *mana*-manipulation: building a bridge between human desire and the power of the sacred animal. The communal meal (δαίς) is the prototype of all religious communion.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Omophagia

The chapter opens with the rite the Bacchos must accomplish:

> "Before he can become a Bacchos, the candidate must have / Fulfilled his red and bleeding feasts. / The omophagia or Eating of Raw Flesh was a rite not confined to the Kouretic initiation of a Bacchos. We meet it again in the Thracian worship of Dionysos." (p. 158)

**The gist of the rite:**
> "Physically repugnant the rite must always be to our modern taste... But our moral repugnance disappears, or at least suffers profound modification, when the gist of the rite is understood. The omophagia was part of a religion, that is a system of sanctities, that knew no gods; it belongs to a social organization that preceded theology." (p. 159)

### 2. Totemism Defined

Harrison adopts Frazer's revised definition:

> "'Totemism,' Dr Frazer says—and we cannot do better than adopt his definition—'is an intimate relation which is supposed to exist between a group of kindred people on the one side and a species of natural or artificial objects on the other side, which objects are called the totems of the human group.'" (p. 160)

**Two notes of totemism:**
1. It has to do with a **group**, not an individual
2. That group is in peculiar relation to a **non-human group**

The word *totem* itself means "tribe": "The Abbé Thavenal says the word is properly *ote* in the sense of 'family or tribe,' the possessive of which is *otem*."

### 3. Totemism as Epistemology

Harrison's key insight—totemism is a stage of thinking:

> "Totemism, then, is not so much a special social structure as a stage in epistemology. It is the reflexion of a very primitive fashion in thinking, or rather feeling, the universe, a feeling the realization of which is essential to any understanding of primitive religion." (p. 164)

The primitive mind does not yet distinguish self from world:

> "Man in the totemistic stage rarely sets himself as individual over against his tribe; he rarely sets himself as man over against the world around him. He has not yet fully captured his individual or his human soul, not yet drawn a circle round his separate self." (p. 163)

### 4. Participation vs. Imitation

Harrison distinguishes μέθεξις from μίμησις:

> "The ceremonies are however still intensely sympathetic and cooperative; they are, as the Greeks would say, rather *methektic* than *mimetic*, participation to rather than imitation of.... The Emu man still feels he *is* an Emu; the feathers he puts on, the gait he emulates, are his own, not another's." (p. 167)

### 5. The Intichiuma Ceremonies

Harrison analyzes Australian totem-multiplication rites:

> "When men of the Emu totem desire to multiply emus they set about it as follows. Several of the men open veins in their arms and allow the blood to stream on the ground till a patch about three yards square is saturated with it.... Further, several men of the totem, acting the part of ancestors of the Emu clan, dress themselves up to resemble emus and imitate the movements and aimless gazing about of the bird." (p. 166)

**Two elements:**
1. Shedding of human blood (the human Emu helps the animal Emu)
2. Counterfeit presentment (mystic communion intensified)

### 6. Sacrifice as Mana-Manipulation

Harrison redefines sacrifice:

> "The word sacrifice, like sacrament, tells the same tale. Etymologically there is nothing in either word that tells of a gift, nor yet of a god, no notion of renouncing, giving up to another and a greater. Sacrifice is simply either 'holy doing' or 'holy making,' ἱερὰ ῥέζειν, just *sanctification*, or, to put it in primitive language, it is handling, manipulating *mana*." (p. 172)

**The bridge metaphor:**
> "When you sacrifice you build as it were a bridge between your *mana*, your will, your desire, which is weak and impotent, and that unseen outside *mana* which you believe to be strong and efficacious." (p. 172)

### 7. The Communal Meal (δαίς)

Food as primary religious value:

> "Religion focuses round the needs and circumstances of life.... The primary need, more primary, more pressing than any other, is Food. Man focuses attention on it, feels acutely about it, organizes his social life in relation to it; it is his primary value, it and its pursuit necessarily become the subject-matter of his simplest religion, his δρώμενα, his rites." (p. 174)

Among the Damaras: "They have great reverence for the ox, only slaughter it on great occasions, and every slaughter is regarded as a common festival."

## Totemism in Greek Religion

### The Bacchae and Shape-Shifting

> "One secret of the thrill of the Bacchae is that the god is always shifting his shape. Dionysos is a human youth, lovely, with curled hair, but in a moment he is a Snake, a Lion, a Wild Bull, a Burning Flame." (p. 169)

This is not late mysticism but primitive totemistic thinking:

> "Now all this is usually explained as a 'late' mysticism, a sort of pantheism, the god in all nature. In reality it goes back to things simpler and deeper. It is important to note that this shift to animal shape is not a power of transformation due to the mature omnipotence of the god; it is with the Dithyrambos from his birth." (p. 170)

The first chorus sings: "Then a horned God was found." The Dithyramb is reborn as a bull-god.

### Totemistic Survivals

| Seriphos lobster-clan | Aelian | Buried dead lobsters with lamentation |

| Psylli Snake-clan | Africa | Tested infants with snake bites |
| Bacchic fawn-tattoo | Vatican cylix | Maenad tattooed with fawn |
| Ivy-leaf branding | Ptolemy Philopator | Jews branded for Dionysos |

### The Fawn and the Ivy

> "The female worshippers of Dionysos were it would seem tattooed with the figure of a fawn; the male worshippers were stamped with an ivy leaf. The ivy, rather than the vine, was in early days the sacred plant of Dionysos." (p. 171)

The Bacchant as fawn:
> "Stamped with the figure of a fawn, she is a fawn and fleeing from the human hounds to the shelter of the woodland she sings: / O feet of a fawn to the greenwood fled, / Alone in the grass and the loveliness." (p. 171)

## Notable Passages

> "A Central Australian pointing to a photograph of himself will say, 'That one is just the same as me,' so is a kangaroo (his totem). We say the Central Australian 'belongs to the kangaroo tribe'; he knows better, he is kangaroo." (p. 162)

— Context: The identity, not mere kinship, of man and totem.

> "If we can once think ourselves back into totemistic days we shall be rid for ever of an ancient and most pernicious orthodoxy, the old doctrine that the religion of primitive man was anthropomorphic. Facts tell us that it was not; that theriomorphism and phytomorphism came first." (p. 164)

— Context: Against the assumption that man always made gods in his own image.

> "'It is a serious though apparently a common mistake,' says Dr Frazer, 'to speak of a totem as a god and say that it is worshipped by the clan. In pure totemism, such as we find it among the Australian aborigines, the totem is never a god, and is never worshipped.'" (p. 168)

— Context: Totemism precedes the very idea of gods.

> "The gist of the Sacrament, the reason it is holy, is, I think, abundantly clear. It is, in intent, an act of communion, of the coming together of the worshipper and his god, and this communion is effected by the common eating of the sacred flesh of the daimon or god." (p. 172)

— Context: Sacrament as communion, not gift.
