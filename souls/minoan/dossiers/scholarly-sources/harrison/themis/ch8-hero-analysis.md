## Overview

This chapter establishes Harrison's revolutionary thesis that the Greek "hero" is not a dead man but a *functionary*—the projection of a group's collective daimon wearing the mask of an individual. The hero is κρείττων τὴν φύσιν ("stronger in nature") not because of personal achievement but because he embodies the Agathos Daimon, the fertility-spirit of the clan. Using evidence from "Hero Feasts," the cult of Theseus, and the Oschophoria festival, Harrison demonstrates that the hero takes on the life-history of the Eniautos-Daimon and thereby provides the ritual forms (agon, pathos, messenger, threnos, theophany) that underlie Attic tragedy.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Hero as Functionary

Harrison overturns the assumption that heroes are commemorated dead men:

> "The 'Hero' is not a dead man with a known name and history commemorated by funeral games. His title stands not for a personality, but for an office, defined by its functions and capable of being filled by a series of representatives." (p. 302)

**The word "hero" means "strong" or "powerful":**
> "κρείττονες, Hesychius tells us, is a general term for heroes and for gods, but not all dead men were κρείττονες. This reminds us that the meaning of the word 'hero' is actually not 'dead man,' but, if we may trust Hesychius, it means simply 'powerful,' 'strong,' 'noble,' 'venerable.'" (p. 291)

### 2. The Hero-Feasts

Harrison analyzes over 300 preserved "Hero Feast" reliefs:

> "A man reclines at a banquet; his wife, according to Athenian custom, is seated by his side. In front is a table loaded with cake and fruits.... But other elements in the design forbid this simple interpretation.... The answer is given, I think, by the snake, who with seeming irrelevance uprears himself beneath the table. The banqueter is a man... And yet he is no real god, no Olympian; rather he is a man masked to his descendants as a daimon, as the Agathos Daimon." (p. 307)

**The rhyton (cornucopia) as daimonic attribute:**
> "They 'assign' the rhyton, the great horn, as appropriate to a hero, because the hero as *daimon* had it from the beginning—the rhyton is the cornucopia." (p. 309)

### 3. The Snake as Life-Daimon

The snake represents not death but reincarnation and fertility:

> "The snake then stands for life and mana, not for death. In the light of the snake as life-daimon, as 'more than mortal,' we understand many birth-stories current in antiquity." (p. 291)

**The Cleomenes story proves the point:**
> "A few days after, those who were guarding the impaled body saw a huge snake (δράκοντα) wound about the head.... Thereupon a superstitious fear fell on the king and such a dread that it started the women on various purification ceremonies, inasmuch as a man had been put to death who was dear to the gods and of more than mortal nature (κρείττονος τὴν φύσιν)." (p. 290)

### 4. Theseus as Hero-Daimon

Theseus exemplifies the transition from group-daimon to individual hero:

> "Theseus lays no claim to be autochthonous.... He comes from without; he represents the break with the gentile system, with the gens and its Basileus; he stands for democracy. His was the *synoikia*." (p. 331)

The Oschophoria preserves the ritual pattern:

> "In the Oschophoria the winner of the race is, as at Olympia, an *Eniautos-daimon* and a *basileus* in one. He dies as an individual and revives as an eternally recurrent functionary." (p. 355)

### 5. The Eniautos-Muthos

The life-history of the year-daimon has fixed elements:

> "The elements of the *Eniautos muthos* are few and simple; its main characteristic is its inevitable, periodic monotony." (p. 350)

**The five elements:**
1. **Agon** (contest) - Race to determine who carries the boughs
2. **Pathos** (death/defeat) - Death of the old king
3. **Messenger** (ἄγγελος) - Announces the pathos
4. **Threnos** (lamentation) - Followed by abrupt reversal
5. **Theophany/Epiphany** - Crowning of the new king

> "At one point in the concluding ceremonies Mr. Dawkins tells us: 'All the implements used were thrown high into the air with cries "Καὶ τοῦ χρόνον," "Next year also."'" (p. 353)

### 6. The Origin of Tragic Form

Attic drama inherits ritual *form* but Homeric *content*:

> "The dithyramb, which was but the periodic festival of the spring renouveau, broke and blossomed so swiftly into the Attic drama because it found such plots to hand; in a word—the forms of Attic drama are the forms of the life-history of an *Eniautos-daimon*; the content is the infinite variety of free and individualized heroic saga—in the largest sense of the word 'Homer.'" (p. 361)

## The Agathos Daimon

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Form** | Snake (ὄφις, δράκων) |
| **Attribute** | Cornucopia (κέρας Ἀμαλθείας) |
| **Function** | Fertility, prosperity, "goodness" |
| **Consort** | Agathe Tyche (Good Fortune) |
| **Examples** | Cecrops, Erechtheus, Sosipolis, Zeus Ktesios |

> "The word ἀγαθός has like δῖος no superlative because it is in itself a superlative, meaning something ἄγαν, something 'very much.' Later of course it was moralized, but to begin with it just means as with us 'good' in the sense of 'abundant.'" (p. 283)

## Eponymous Heroes

Harrison shows that "eponymous heroes" are projections of groups, not founders:

| Hero | Group | Relation |
|------|-------|----------|
| Cecrops | Cecropidae | Projection of the Cecropidae |
| Erechtheus | Erechtheidae | Projection of the Erechtheidae |
| Ion | Ionians | Artificial eponym, emptied of content |
| Phytalos | Phytalidae | "Plant-Men," real tribal custodians |

> "An 'eponymous hero' never 'gives' his name, he always receives it. Cecrops is the projection of the Cecropidae, Erechtheus of the Erechtheidae; neither is a real actual man, only an ancestor invented to express the unity of a group." (p. 275)

---

## Notable Passages

> "The individual members of the group of the Cecropidae die, man after man, generation after generation; Cecrops, who never lived at all, lives for ever, as a snake. He is the δαίμων γέννης, the spirit, the genius of the race, he stands not for personal immortality in our modern sense, not for the negation of death, ἀθανασία, but for the perennial renewal of life through death, for Reincarnation, for παλιγγενεσία." (p. 294)

— Context: The snake-daimon represents cyclical rebirth, not individual survival.

> "Generation is not, as Plato reminds us, a straight line stretching after death into an interminable remote immortality, it is a circle, a κύκλος, always returning upon itself." (p. 295)

— Context: Greek concept of reincarnation vs. linear immortality.

> "The monotony of these folk-plays is almost intolerable, and if we were asked to see in them the germ of all the life and splendour and variety of Attic drama we might rightly rebel; but we are not. What the δρώμενα of the *Eniautos-daimon* gave to Attic drama was, not its content, but its ritual form." (p. 352)

— Context: How ritual form and saga content combine to make tragedy.

## The Hippolytus Cult at Troezen

Harrison analyzes Hippolytus as a paradigmatic Eniautos-Daimon:

> "Hippolytus was, ritually, just another form of the same Year-daimon, who is torn to pieces and born again. He was worshipped at Troezen with a hero-cult that shows all the marks of the Eniautos pattern." (p. 343)

**The ritual at Troezen:**
| Element | Practice | Significance |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Hair-offering** | Maidens cut hair before marriage | Dedication to the dying god |
| **Mourning** | Annual lamentation for Hippolytus | Threnos of the Eniautos-muthos |
| **Refusal to name** | His name not spoken | Typical of tabu surrounding the slain god |
| **Artemis connection** | Shared temple precinct | Year-daimon and his divine partner |

> "At Troezen there was a temple of Hippolytus of greatest renown. Within the precinct was also a temple of Apollo Epibaterios. Before the temple was a stadium named after Hippolytus, and above it a temple of Aphrodite Kataskopia, 'Aphrodite who looks down,' for from here Phaedra used to watch Hippolytus at his exercises." (Pausanias 2.32.1)

### The Hair-Offering Ritual

The practice of maidens cutting their hair for Hippolytus parallels other year-daimon cults:

> "This rite of the hair-offering is intimately bound up with initiation and with marriage, for initiation is but a social birth, a new beginning. At Delos the maidens before marriage cut off their hair and wound it about a spindle, laying it on the tomb of the Hyperborean maidens." (p. 344)

**Parallel hair-offerings:**
| Site | Recipient | Offerers |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Troezen | Hippolytus | Maidens before marriage |
| Delos | Hyperborean Maidens | Maidens before marriage |
| Megara | Iphinoe | Maidens before marriage |
| Achaia | Rivers | Youths at coming-of-age |

### The Sparagmos Pattern

Hippolytus's death by being torn apart by his horses follows the σπαραγμός (sparagmos) pattern:

> "The manner of his death is significant. He is torn to pieces—dragged by his horses just as Pentheus is torn by the Maenads, Orpheus by the Thracian women, Actaeon by his own hounds. This is the typical fate of the Year-daimon: to be rent asunder that his life-force may be scattered abroad." (p. 345)

**The sparagmos parallels:**
| Victim | Agents | Context |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Hippolytus | Horses | Euripides' tragedy |
| Pentheus | Maenads | Euripides' *Bacchae* |
| Orpheus | Thracian women | Apollodorus |
| Actaeon | Hounds | Ovid/Apollodorus |
| Zagreus | Titans | Orphic tradition |

> "The heroes who suffer sparagmos are not merely dying men—they are Eniautos-daimones whose death scatters the fertility they embody. The dismemberment is not punishment but sacrament." (p. 346)

## The Hagia Triada Figure Explained

Harrison returns to the Hagia Triada sarcophagus:

> "The figure standing in front of the building is not, I think, a god, not Dionysos Dendrites, nor is he a man, a particular dead individual who is having a funeral at the moment. Rather he is a daimon-hero, and the building before which he stands is a *heroon*.... He is certainly I think a *kouros* like in youth and strength to the *kouroi* who approach him with offerings, only stiff and somewhat xoanon-like as becomes one who is a daimon not a man." (p. 363)
