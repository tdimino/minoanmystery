# Chapter IV: Magic and Tabu

## Overview

This chapter establishes the theoretical framework for understanding magic as the manipulation of *mana*, with *tabu* as its negative counterpart. Harrison argues that magic was originally public, social, and royal—not the hole-and-corner practice of later times. Using the Dipylon rain-making fragment and the legends of Salmoneus and Picus, she demonstrates that the medicine-king made the weather before any god existed to control it. The bird-magician Picus reveals the undifferentiated unity of bird, seer, magician, and king that preceded anthropomorphic theology.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Magic as θεραπεία τῶν θεῶν

Harrison begins with Plato's surprising definition:

> "In the first dialogue that bears the name of Alcibiades Socrates is urging on Alcibiades to an exceptionally high standard of conduct.... 'the one who is wisest teaches the magic (μαγείαν) of Zoroaster the son of Horomazos'; and then to our surprise Socrates adds by way of explanation, 'the art of the magician is the service (θεραπεία) of the gods. The same man gives instruction in kingly duties' (τὰ βασιλικά)." (p. 111)

**Key insight**: Magic was the service of the gods, and knowledge of magic was part of royal education.

### 2. The Dipylon Rain-Making Fragment

Harrison analyzes an eighth-century vase showing ceremonial rain-making:

> "A man is seated before an altar on which is a great 'Mycenaean' shield. In either hand he holds an implement... The soft plash is unmistakable. *He is making rain*; making it in the simplest yet most magical fashion." (p. 113)

The implements are gourd-rattles, used worldwide for rain-magic. The medicine-man is not worshipping the shield—he is actively making weather.

### 3. Salmoneus the Thunder-King

Harrison rehabilitates Salmoneus from blasphemer to medicine-king:

> "'Salmoneus,' Apollodorus tells us, 'said that he himself was Zeus, and he took away from Zeus his sacrifices and ordered men to sacrifice to him.' Of course he did nothing of the sort: there was no Zeus, there were no sacrifices. What he really did, Apollodorus tells us in the next sentence, he made the weather: 'he fastened bronze cauldrons by straps of hide to his chariot and dragged them after him and said that he was thundering, and threw up blazing torches into the sky and said that he was lightening.'" (p. 114)

At Krannon in Thessaly: "there was kept a bronze waggon, and 'when the land suffered from drought they shook it by way of praying the god for rain, and it was said rain came.'"

### 4. Le sacré c'est le père du dieu

Harrison's central thesis on the priority of sanctity:

> "We now know, from a study of the customs and representations of primitive peoples, that, broadly speaking, the reverse is true, a thing is regarded as sacred, and out of that sanctity, given certain conditions, emerges a daimon and ultimately a god. *Le sacré, c'est le père du dieu*." (p. 110)

The thunderbolt is sacred before Zeus exists to wield it.

### 5. Tabu as Negative Mana

Harrison defines the relationship between mana and tabu:

> "In Greece a place that was struck by lightning became an ἄβατον, a spot not to be trodden on, unapproachable.... The other name for these tabu-ed places speaks clearly—they were ἐνηλοσίαι, places of coming. This Pollux tells us, is the name given to places on which a bolt from heaven has descended." (p. 129)

**The ἄβατον** (forbidden place) is fenced because it is charged with dangerous *mana*, not because a god cursed it.

### 6. Picus the Medicine-King

Harrison analyzes the Latin woodpecker-king:

> "In the figure of Picus are united, or rather as yet undifferentiated, notions, to us incompatible, of bird, seer-magician, king and daimon, if not god. The daimon as we have already seen with respect to the Kouros Kings were not deified because there were as yet no *dei*. The medicine-king is predeistic, but possessed of those powers which later and more cultured ages have relegated to the 'gods.'" (p. 148)

Picus and Faunus taught Numa the thunder-charm: "a purification (καθαρμόν) against thunderbolts... compounded of onions, hairs, and pilchards."

## The Medicine-Bird

### Bird-Mana and Weather-Making

Harrison argues birds were first weather-makers, then weather-portents:

> "This early way of thinking comes out most clearly in the case of a bird who never became the 'attribute' of any Olympian, the homely woodpecker.... The mantic weather-bird precedes the prophetic god." (p. 137)

**Aristophanes' *Birds*** preserves the memory:
> "We are Delphi, Ammon, Dodona, in fine / We are every oracular temple and shrine... / If birds are your omens, it clearly will follow / That birds are the proper prophetic Apollo." (p. 138)

### Picus at Tiora

> "Three hundred stadia further (in the country of the Apennines) is Tiora, called Matiene. Here there is said to have been an oracle of Mars of great antiquity. It is reported to have been similar in character to the fabled oracle at Dodona, except that, whereas at Dodona it was said that a dove perched on a sacred oak gave oracles, among the Aborigines the oracles were given in like fashion by a god-sent bird called by them Picus (the Greeks name it Dryokolaptes) which appears on a wooden pillar." (p. 141)

## Notable Passages

> "Magic was no hole and corner practice but an affair of public ritual, performed with full social sanction. We have in fact a state of things like that which Socrates attributed to the Persians, a social phase in which magic was the service (θεραπεία) of the gods; instruction about it might well be given as part of the duties of a king (τὰ βασιλικά); in a word magic was of the state, not of the individual." (p. 115)

— Context: Against the view that magic was always marginal and disreputable.

> "A tool is but an extension, an amplification, of a man's personality. If the savage feels that he can get *Wa-kon'-da*, surely that *Wa-kon'-da* can pass into that outer personality which is his tool, his weapon.... The shield on the altar is sacred because it is a shield, a tool, a defensive weapon, part of a man's personality, charged with magical force." (p. 120)

— Context: Why the Mycenaean shield is sacred without any god.

> "The very vividness, the oneness of the perception, seen with the single intention of the poet, makes it to us hard of apprehension.... In the *Bacchae* we catch the god in the three stages of his making." (p. 131)

— Context: Dionysos in Euripides as simultaneously human leader, daimon, and god.

## Hesiod's Pious Man

Harrison analyzes the *Works and Days* conclusion:

> "Lucky and bless'd is he, who, knowing all these things, / Toils in the fields, blameless before the Immortals, / Knowing in birds and not overstepping tabus." (p. 134)

The pious man's duties are not prayer or sacrifice but **observance of sanctities**—knowing birds and avoiding tabu. The Olympians are "an artificial background."
