## Overview

This famous excursus argues that Greek tragedy preserves the formal structure of the Dionysiac *Sacer Ludus*—the ritual death and rebirth of the Year-Daimon. Murray identifies five constant elements (Agon, Pathos, Messenger, Threnos, Theophany) that appear in tragedy because tragedy originated as ritual drama. While the *content* of tragedy strayed to Homeric saga, the *forms* retained their ritual origin. Murray demonstrates these patterns systematically in Euripides' *Bacchae*, *Hippolytus*, and *Andromache*, and shows their presence throughout Aeschylus and Sophocles.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Tragedy as Sacer Ludus

Murray's founding premise:

> "The following note presupposes certain general views about the origin and essential nature of Greek Tragedy. It assumes that Tragedy is in origin a Ritual Dance, a *Sacer Ludus*, representing normally the *Aition*, or supposed historical Cause, of some current ritual practice." (p. 341)

**The Dionysiac core:**
> "Further, it assumes, in accord with the overwhelming weight of ancient tradition, that the Dance in question is originally or centrally that of Dionysus; and it regards Dionysus, in this connection, as the spirit of the Dithyramb or Spring *Drômenon*, an 'Eniautos-Daimon,' who represents the cyclic death and rebirth of the world, including the rebirth of the tribe by the return of the heroes or dead ancestors." (p. 341)

### 2. The Five Ritual Forms

Murray identifies the underlying *muthos* of Eniautos celebrations:

> "If we examine the kind of *muthos* which seems to underly the various 'Eniautos' celebrations we shall find:
> 1. An **Agon** or Contest, the Year against its enemy, Light against Darkness, Summer against Winter.
> 2. A **Pathos** of the Year-Daimon, generally a ritual or sacrificial death, in which Adonis or Attis is slain by the tabu animal, the *Pharmakos* stoned, Osiris, Dionysus, Pentheus, Orpheus, Hippolytus torn to pieces (σπαραγμός).
> 3. A **Messenger**. For this *Pathos* seems seldom or never to be actually performed under the eyes of the audience.... It is announced by a messenger.
> 4. A **Threnos** or Lamentation. Specially characteristic, however, is a clash of contrary emotions, the death of the old being followed by a lamentation (θρῆνος), the birth of the new by a paean of joy.
> 5. A triumphant **Epiphany**, an appearance or *Anodos* of the reborn God." (p. 343)

### 3. Peripeteia and Anagnorisis

Murray follows Dieterich in connecting Aristotle's terms to mystery ritual:

> "Dieterich has already shown that a characteristic of the *Sacer Ludus* in the mysteries was a *Peripeteia*, or Reversal. It was a change from sorrow to joy, from darkness and sights of inexplicable terror to light and the discovery of the reborn God. Such a *Peripeteia* is clearly associated with an *Anagnorisis*, a Recognition or Discovery." (p. 342)

**Mystery formulae:**
> "Such formulae from the mysteries as Θαρσεῖτε, Μῦσται, τὸ θεοῦ σεσωσμένον—Ἡράκλεα μὲν ἀπέκτεινα, Ἡράκλεα δὲ ἀναστήσας—imply a close connection between the *Peripeteia* and the *Anagnorisis*." (p. 342)

### 4. The Bacchae as Crucial Test

Murray analyzes the *Bacchae* as the clearest example of the ritual pattern:

> "When we remember that Pentheus is only another form of Dionysus himself—like Zagreus, Orpheus, Osiris and the other *daimons* who are torn in pieces and put together again—we can see that the *Bacchae* is simply the old *Sacer Ludus* itself, scarcely changed at all, except for the doubling of the hero into himself and his enemy." (p. 346)

**Structure of the Bacchae:**
| Section | Lines | Form |
|---------|-------|------|
| 787–976 | Agon | Contest between Dionysus and Pentheus |
| 1024–1152 | Pathos + Messenger | Σπαραγμός of Pentheus narrated |
| 1153–1329 | Threnos + Anagnorisis | Lamentation; Agave recognizes fragments |
| 1330+ | Epiphany | Appearance of Dionysus |

### 5. Form vs. Content

Murray's key distinction:

> "It is of course clear that Tragedy, as we possess it, contains many non-Dionysiac elements.... Indeed I think it can be shown that every extant tragedy contains somewhere towards the end the celebration of a tabu tomb. This point we must gladly concede to Professor Ridgeway. I wish to suggest, however, that while the content has strayed far from Dionysus, the forms of tragedy retain clear traces of the original drama of the Death and Rebirth of the Year Spirit." (p. 341)

### 6. The Messenger's Ritual Function

The Messenger is not a dramatic convenience but a ritual necessity:

> "We have seen that in the *Sacer Ludus* the *Pathos* is normally announced by a Messenger. This is also the case in Tragedy. The Messenger was in fact an essential, not to say an indispensable, part of the tragic apparatus. He is always present in the extant plays of Æschylus and Sophocles; he is wanting only in two plays of Euripides." (p. 344)

### 7. Theophany in Aeschylus

Murray demonstrates that Euripides' *deus ex machina* continues Aeschylean practice:

> "It has not been observed that in this, as in so many of his supposed novelties, Euripides is following the tradition of Aeschylus.... Aeschylus was still operating with trilogies, not with single plays, so that his *Theophanies* are normally saved up to the end of the trilogy and then occur on a grand scale." (p. 348)

**Aeschylean Trilogy Analyses:**

| Trilogy | Ending Type | Theophany |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| *Oresteia* | Second (joyful) | Grand theophany of Apollo, Athena, and transformed Furies |
| *Supplices* trilogy | Second (joyful) | Epiphany of Aphrodite founding marriage (Nauck fr. 44) |
| *Persae* trilogy | First (threnos) | Darius evoked as *theos/daimon* (lines 644, 642) from tomb |
| *Theban* trilogy | First (threnos) | Ends in lamentation; no rebirth theophany |
| *Prometheus* trilogy | Second (joyful) | Likely Zeus appearance concluding reconciliation |

**Fragmentary plays with epiphanies:**
- *Amymone*, *Bassarai*, *Neaniskoi*, *Memnon* (Eos bringing immortality), *Edonoi*
- Thespis's titles preserve ritual origins: *Hiereis* (Priests), *Ethoi*, *Pentheus*, *Phorbas*

### 8. The Prorrhesis: Ritual Announcement

Murray identifies the *prorrhesis* (preliminary announcement) as a ritual form preserved in tragedy:

> "Before the actual beginning of the *Sacer Ludus* there was a *Prorrhesis*, a preliminary announcement, made by a herald or priest."

**Function in tragedy:**
- Explains the ritual origin of Euripidean prologues
- The *exangelos* (messenger from within) announces what cannot be shown
- This ritual necessity became dramatic convention

## Analysis of Three Plays

### The Bacchae

> "We have the whole sequence: *Agon*, *Pathos* and *Messenger*, *Threnos*, *Anagnorisis* and *Peripeteia*, and *Epiphany*. The *daimon* is fought against, torn to pieces, announced as dead, wept for, collected and recognized, and revealed in his new divine life." (p. 346)

### The Hippolytus

> "We are just one step further from the original ritual. For who was Hippolytus? He was, ritually, just another form of the same Year-*daimon*, who is torn to pieces and born again." (p. 347)

| Section | Lines | Form |
|---------|-------|------|
| 902–1101 | Agon | Theseus vs. Hippolytus |
| 1153–1267 | Pathos + Messenger | Σπαραγμός by horses |
| 1283–end | Threnos + Epiphany | Artemis appears, brings Anagnorisis |

### The Andromache

| Section | Lines | Form |
|---------|-------|------|
| 547–765 | Agon | Peleus vs. Menelaus |
| 1070–1165 | Pathos + Messenger | Stoning narrated |
| 1166–1225 | Threnos | Lamentation |
| 1226+ | Theophany | Thetis brings comfort |

## The Satyr-Play Connection

Murray explains the relationship of the satyr-play to ritual rebirth:

> "Those who have read Miss Harrison's article on the Kouretes will recognize that the Satyrs are the ὀπαδοὶ δαίμονες in the rout of Dionysus, especially associated with his 'initiations and hierourgiai'—that is, exactly with our *Sacer Ludus* of Dionysus." (p. 344)

**Satyrs as ritual attendants:**
- *Opadoi daimones* = attendant spirits in Dionysus's rout
- Associated specifically with *hierourgiai* (sacred rites) and initiations
- Strabo (pp. 466-8) provides evidence for this connection

**Connection to anodos:**
The satyr-play preserved the joyful *anodos* (rising up) element of the ritual—the rebirth moment. Satyrs were associated with the *anodos* of Kore, suggesting their function was to celebrate the return of the dead.

**The cutting-off problem:**
> "The cutting-off of the Satyr-play left the tragic trilogy without its proper close. What was it to do?... Both types of tragedy occur, but gradually the second tends to predominate." (p. 345)

**Two types of tragic ending:**
1. **Threnos type**: Ends in lamentation (death without rebirth shown)
2. **Theophany type**: Ends in divine appearance (rebirth celebrated)

## Notable Passages

> "The *Bacchae* is a most instructive instance of the formation of drama out of ritual. It shows us how slight a step was necessary for Thespis or another to turn the Year-Ritual into real drama." (p. 346)

— Context: The *Bacchae* as evidence for ritual origin.

> "Observe the sequence in which these should normally occur: *Agon*, *Pathos*, *Messenger*, *Threnos*, *Theophany*, or, we might say, *Anagnorisis* and *Theophany*." (p. 343)

— Context: The canonical tragic structure.

> "The Messenger was in fact an essential, not to say an indispensable, part of the tragic apparatus." (p. 344)

— Context: Why the pathos is never shown directly.

> "In the *Andromache* the persons are all varied: it is Peleus and Menelaus who have the contest; it is Neoptolemus who is slain and mourned; it is Thetis who appears as divine." (p. 347)

— Context: How content varies while form remains constant.
