# Jane Ellen Harrison (1850–1928)

## Scholar Profile

- **Full Name**: Jane Ellen Harrison
- **Dates**: 1850–1928
- **Affiliation**: Newnham College, Cambridge (Fellow and Lecturer)
- **Training**: Classical philology at Cambridge; pioneered women's participation in classical scholarship in Britain
- **Languages**: Greek, Latin, German, French, Russian (later in life)

## Why Harrison Matters for Kothar

Harrison is the founding figure of the Cambridge Ritualist school. Her work provides Kothar with:

1. **Ritual-myth theory** - Myth arises from *dromenon* (ritual enactment), not the reverse
2. **Kouretes analysis** - The Hymn to Diktaean Zeus as a window into Cretan initiation practices
3. **Eniautos-Daimon** - The year-spirit concept (coined by Harrison, elaborated by F.M. Cornford)
4. **Mystery vs. Olympian distinction** - Dionysos embodies *durée* (life), while Olympians are static ideals
5. **Collective representation** - Durkheimian sociology applied to Greek religion

Harrison's approach complements Gordon's linguistic analysis with ritual theory—where Gordon deciphers Linear A as Semitic, Harrison explains why those cults took the forms they did.

## Biography

Jane Ellen Harrison was born in Yorkshire in 1850 and educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College before becoming one of the first women to study classics at Cambridge. Though never awarded a Cambridge degree (women were excluded until 1948), she became a Fellow of Newnham College and one of the most influential classical scholars of her era.

Her early work focused on Greek vase painting and archaeology. The turning point came with *Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion* (1903), which revealed the chthonic, pre-Olympian stratum of Greek religion. *Themis* (1912) extended this analysis through the lens of Durkheimian sociology and Bergsonian philosophy, arguing that Greek religion arose from collective ritual action (*dromenon*) rather than individual belief.

The Cambridge Ritualists—Harrison, Gilbert Murray, and F.M. Cornford—fundamentally reoriented the study of Greek religion away from literary analysis toward ritual origins.

> "The Olympian gods—that is, the anthropomorphic gods of Homer and Pheidias and the mythographers—seemed to me like a bouquet of cut-flowers whose bloom is brief, because they have been severed from their roots." (*Themis*, Introduction)

## Core Thesis

Greek religion evolved from collective ritual (*dromenon*) to individualized theology:

1. **Primitive stage**: Ritual enactment (*dromenon*) of seasonal renewal, initiation, fertility
2. **Daimon stage**: Collective emotion projects a *daimon*—a year-spirit embodying group life
3. **God stage**: The *daimon* is intellectualized, fixed in human form, removed from ritual origins
4. **Olympian stage**: Gods become literary characters, beautiful but religiously dead

The mystery religions (Dionysos, Orphism) preserved the original life-affirming impulse through ritual participation. The Olympians, by contrast, represent intellectual abstraction—admirable as art, inadequate as religion.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| *Dromenon* | "Thing done"—ritual enactment with magical intent |
| *Thiasos* | Sacred band or cult group; Dionysos always attended by a thiasos |
| *Eniautos-Daimon* | Year-spirit embodying the cycle of death and renewal |
| *Durée* | Bergson's term for lived time/life-force; mystery religions express durée |
| Collective representation | Durkheim's concept: religious ideas arise from group consciousness |

## Key Contributions by Work

### Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion (1912)

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press

**Dedicatee**: Gilbert Murray (χαριστήριον—"a thank-offering")

**Core Thesis**: The Hymn of the Kouretes discovered at Palaikastro embodies primitive Greek religion in fossilized form. The Kouretes—armed dancers who invoke the "Greatest Kouros"—are initiated young men whose collective ritual projects the figure of a *daimon*. This *daimon* is not a god but a year-spirit (*Eniautos-Daimon*), the embodiment of cyclical renewal.

**Key innovations**:
- Application of Bergson (*durée*) and Durkheim (collective representations) to Greek religion
- Distinction between mystery religions (participatory, life-affirming) and Olympians (intellectual, static)
- Analysis of hero-cult as functionary worship, not commemoration of historical individuals
- Identification of ritual forms preserved in Greek tragedy (Murray's Excursus)

### The Kouretes and Zeus Kouros (1908)

**Published in**: *Annual of the British School at Athens*, Vol. XV

**Core Thesis**: The Kouretes are a Cretan initiation society whose rites illuminate the Orphic mysteries of Zagreus. The "Titans" who dismember Zagreus are not mythological beings but initiators wearing white clay—masked performers in a ritual of death and rebirth.

**Key innovations**:
- Strabo's four characteristics of Kouretes: δαίμονες, magicians/seers, armed dancers, παιδοτρόφοι
- Bull-roarer (*ῥόμβος*) as acoustic representation of thunder
- Australian Wiradthuri parallels for initiation death/rebirth
- Euripides' *Cretans* fragment as evidence for Idaean initiation

### Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (1921)

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press

**Core Thesis**: A summary of Harrison's career findings, integrating insights from Jung, Freud, and Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovíóv. Religion fundamentally serves life-conservation through two ritual modes: expulsion (driving out evil) and impulsion (bringing in good).

**Key innovations**:
- "Out with Famine, in with Health and Wealth" as primal religious formula
- Gorgoneion (prophylactic terror) vs. Liknon (fertility blessing) as embodying the two modes
- Religion without gods is possible—Buddhism proves it
- Aristotle's praise/blame distinction in poetry derives from ritual impulsion/expulsion

## Scholarly Lineage

### Builds On
- **E.B. Tylor** - Evolutionary anthropology, "survivals" in culture
- **J.G. Frazer** - *The Golden Bough*, vegetation spirits, dying-and-rising gods

- **Walter Burkert** - *Homo Necans*, ritual theory of sacrifice
- **René Girard** - Scapegoat theory, collective violence
- Ritual studies generally—Harrison's *dromenon*-first approach remains foundational
