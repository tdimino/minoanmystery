## Overview

This concluding work summarizes Harrison's career findings on Greek religion, distilling *Prolegomena* (1903) and *Themis* (1912) into their essential arguments. Harrison demonstrates that religion is fundamentally social and arises from two primal impulses: **expulsion** (riddance of evil) and **impulsion** (enhancement of life), captured in the Chaeronea formula "Out with Famine, in with Health and Wealth." She traces religious development through four stages—totemism, initiation, king-god, and fertility drama—showing how the god emerges as "desire exteriorized, personified" from collective ritual. The work also acknowledges new debts to Jung, Freud, and the Russian philosopher Solovíóv.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Dual Impulse: Expulsion and Impulsion

Harrison's foundational thesis—all religion serves to conserve and promote life:

> "The religious impulse is directed, if I am right, primarily to one end and one only, the conservation and promotion of life. This end is served in two ways, one negative, one positive, by the riddance of whatever is conceived to be hostile and by the enhancement of whatever is conceived of as favourable to life. Religious rites are primarily of two kinds and two only, of expulsion and impulsion."

**The Chaeronea formula:**
> "A household slave was driven out of doors with rods of *agnus castus*... and over him were pronounced the words 'Out with Famine, in with Health and Wealth.'"

### 2. Gorgoneion vs. Liknon

Two ritual implements embody the dual impulse:

> "The Gorgoneion... is in fact nothing but a ritual mask, a grinning face with glaring eyes, protruding beast-like tusks and pendent tongue. The Greek used the Gorgoneion for what he called 'prophylactic' purposes, that is to scare away all evil things."

> "Very different in its functions was the *liknon* or winnowing-fan.... The *liknon* became to the Greeks the great symbol and vehicle of purification physical and spiritual. But unlike the Gorgoneion it was wholly alien to the emotions of aversion and fear. It purified in order to promote growth and fertility."

**Marriage formulary preserved the dual purpose:**
> "At Athenian weddings a boy, both of whose parents were alive, carried a *liknon* full of loaves and pronounced the words: 'Bad have I fled, better have I found.'"

### 3. From Bone Fire to Bon-Feu

The shift from fear to hope defines religious progress:

> "The word 'bonfire' is not, as used to be held, *bon-feu*, good fire, *feu de joie*; it is bane or bone fire, a fire for burning up old bones and rubbish of every kind. Purification and the rubbish-heap first, and only later, because of the splendid blaze, a glow like the life-giving sun, jollification, fertility, impulsion."

> "The history of man's religious development from superstitious fear to faith and hope and charity is largely the history of the shift from *bone fire* to *bon-feu*."

### 4. Religion Without Gods

Harrison argues religion precedes and does not require divinity:

> "We must face at the outset the fact that religion does not presuppose a god.... Buddhism claims perhaps more worshippers than any other religion.... No one denies to Buddhism the name of religion, yet Buddhism is godless, pure atheism."

> "Is there then no distinction between religion and magic? There is, and it is a distinction very simple but all important; religion is social, magic is or may be individual, religion is of the group however small, magic of the single unit."

### 5. The Four Stages of Religious Development

Harrison identifies four key formations:

| Stage | Key Feature | Contribution to Religion |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Totem, Tabu, Exogamy** | Group badges, prohibitions | Sanctity, sacrament, sin, animal worship |
| **Initiation Ceremonies** | *Rites de passage*, death/rebirth | Tribe-making, ancestor connection |
| **Medicine-Man and King-God** | Sanctity focused in person | Personal divinity, regalia |
| **Fertility Play** | Year-drama, Agon, Death/Resurrection | Dramatic forms, Year-Daimon |

### 6. Totemism as Group Badge

The totem is primarily social, not zoological:

> "The word *totem* means not plant or animal but simply family, group or tribe. It is important to grasp this clearly as the supposed kinship of man with various plants and animals is a fact so odd that it has arrested undue attention and tended to obscure the real significance of the totem."

> "Primitive man thinks or rather feels in terms of his group: the group is his universe."

### 7. Ambivalenz and the Sacred

Harrison adopts Freud's term for the double-edged nature of tabu:

> "This *Ambivalenz* is characteristic of the feeling of the son to the father, and of all savages towards tabued objects. It is the attitude of obedience to a non-natural prohibition, the desire remaining while the prohibition holds."

> "Holiness has just this character of *Ambivalenz*; the thing that is *sacer* as Robertson Smith long ago recognized is impure as well as pure, a danger as well as a safeguard, it attracts and repels."

### 8. Initiation as Rite de Passage

All life crises share the same structure:

> "All ceremonies concerned directly with the welfare of man have this transition character, ceremonies of birth, of puberty, of marriage and of death are all alike in mechanism, they all facilitate the passage from one state to another."

> "The great Eleusinian mysteries were primarily the rite of man's maturity side by side with rites to promote the maturity of earth's fruits."

**Death as initiation:**
> "That to die is to be initiated into the 'Higher Mysteries' was to the Greek a literal fact. This initiation was consummated by a Sacred Marriage with the Earth Mother."

### 9. The Kouretes and Their Leader

The initiated band projects its leader as god:

> "The Kouretes are the young men just come to maturity, just initiated into the fertility dance of their tribe; they invoke their leader as lord of moisture and life, or as they say, 'Lord of all that is wet and gleaming.'"

> "In the famous *Hymn of the Kouretes* Zeus himself as chief dancer is addressed as Greatest Kouros or Young Man, head of the initiate band."

### 10. The God as Exteriorized Desire

Harrison's summary definition:

> "Le dieu c'est le désir extériorisé, personnifié" ("The god is desire exteriorized, personified").

> "Religion then in these its two aspects is no longer an attitude towards the unseen and unknown but an emotion towards the known and experienced; it is the offspring not of fear but of desire, the gods are human will and passion incarnate."

### 11. Ritual Forms in Tragedy

Harrison confirms Murray's thesis:

> "While the contents of the plots come from the heroic saga the ritual forms in which that content is cast derive straight from the *dromena* the doings of the Year-Daimon. Such forms are the Prologue, the Agon, the Pathos, the Messenger's Speech, the Threnos or Lamentation, the Anagnorisis or Recognition and the final Theophany."

## The Viza Folk-Play

Harrison describes a Thracian fertility drama still performed:

> "At Viza, the ancient Bizue in Thrace... may still be seen a folk-play which by its very simplicity and even baldness makes singularly clear its original magical intent."

**Structure:**
1. Masqueraders demand food with phallus-shaped knocker
2. Ploughing and sowing pantomime
3. Child grows to maturity, demands bride
4. Antagonist fights, is killed, lamented, and **resurrects**
5. Ploughing repeated with prayer: "May wheat be ten piastres the bushel!"

> "The intent of the whole ritual could not be clearer, it is a fertility drama 'that the poor may eat.'"

## Notable Passages

> "Aristotle with his inspired amazing insight saw and said that poetry had two forms: *praise* which issued in hymns and heroic poetry (ἐγκώμια), *blame* which yielded iambic satire (ψόγουξ). Aristotle could not and did not know that these two modes arose out of two ritual forms."

— Context: The literary consequences of expulsion/impulsion.

> "The discovery of its social origin is perhaps the greatest advance yet made in the scientific study of religion."

— Context: Harrison's endorsement of Durkheim's sociology.

> "It is only when the god is separated from the rite that he dies down into a sterile, immobile perfection."

— Context: Why Olympian gods are religiously "dead."

> "A god so projected *is* part of the worshipper and is felt and realized as such; divinity has not yet separated off from humanity. The dancer in the sacred rite cannot be said to worship his god, he lives him, experiences him."

— Context: The original unity of worshipper and worshipped.
