## Overview

This chapter establishes Allen's central argument: Native American cosmology centers on a **female Creatrix** who creates through **thought** rather than biological birth. This elevates feminine power beyond mere fertility.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: The Thought Woman theology provides a parallel to Minoan goddess traditions—a female divinity who creates through will/thought rather than biological reproduction. This challenges reductive "fertility goddess" interpretations of Aegean religion.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Creatrix: She Who Thinks

**Thought Woman (Ts'its'tsi'nako):**

> "There is a spirit that pervades everything, that is capable of powerful song and radiant movement, and that moves in and out of the mind... Old Spider Woman is one name for this quintessential spirit, and Serpent Woman is another." (p. 28)

> "At the center of all is Woman, and no thing is sacred (cooked, ripe, as the Keres Indians of Laguna Pueblo say it) without her blessing, her thinking." (p. 28)

**Keres creation:**
> "In the beginning Tse che nako, Thought Woman finished everything, thoughts, and the names of all things. She finished also all the languages." (p. 28)

### 2. Beyond "Fertility Goddess"

Allen explicitly rejects Western categorization:

> "To assign to this great being the position of 'fertility goddess' is exceedingly demeaning: it trivializes the tribes and it trivializes the power of woman. Woman bears, that is true. She also destroys. That is true. She also wars and hexes and mends and breaks." (p. 29)

### 3. Parallel Goddess Figures

| Deity | Tribe | Key Attributes |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Thought Woman** | Keres | Creates by thinking; both Mother and Father |
| **Hard Beings Woman** | Hopi | Sea goddess; breathes life into effigies; moon and stars |
| **Sky Woman** | Iroquois | Falls from sky; Grandmother Turtle; earth-island |
| **White Buffalo Woman** | Lakota | Brought Sacred Pipe; lives in cave; Four Winds |
| **Iyatiku** | Keres | Mother of people; resides in Shipap; left her heart |

### 4. Creation Through Thought, Not Copulation

> "In Keres theology, creation does not take place through copulation. In the beginning existed Thought Woman and her dormant sisters, and Thought Woman thinks creation and sings her two sisters into life." (p. 31)

### 5. Snake Man's Mother: Female Initiator

> "The Navajo have a ceremonial and an accompanying myth that commemorate the gain of such a gift as the result of a battle with some Pueblos. The hero in that tale is a woman who journeys to the spirit world with Snake Man, where she is initiated by Snake Man's mother. After she has passed the tests provided for her learning, she is given particular rites to take back to her people." (p. 39)

**Key insights:**
- Female hero journeys to spirit world
- **Snake Man's mother** is the initiator who tests and teaches
- Woman brings back sacred ceremonies for her people
- Pattern: snake-deity-mother as source of ritual knowledge

**Key theological points:**
- Thought Woman is "both Mother and Father to all people and to all creatures"
- "Female thought is seen as the origin of material and nonmaterial reality"
- Sisters (Uretsete and Naotsete) are **coequals**, not daughters
- Creation through **ritual magic** and song, not biological reproduction

### 6. Complementary Duality

**Internal/External Chiefs:**

| Role | Function | Symbolism |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Cacique** (Tiamuni Hotchin) | Internal harmony, peace | White, internal fire |
| **Hotchin** (War Captain) | External affairs, boundaries | Red, external fire |

> "The core/womb of the earth is inward fire as the heart of heaven, the sun, is external fire. The Cherokee and their northern cousins the Iroquois acknowledge the femaleness of both fires: the sun is female to them both, as is the earth." (p. 36)
