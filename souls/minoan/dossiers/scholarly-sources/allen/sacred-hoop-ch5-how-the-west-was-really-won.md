## Overview

This chapter documents the **concurrent degradation of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and traditional spiritual leaders** as central to colonial conquest. The destruction of these interconnected groups was deliberate policy, not natural evolution.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Documents how colonizers systematically target women, gender-variant individuals, and spiritual leaders together because their power is interconnected. This provides a template for understanding similar dynamics in Bronze Age conquest patterns.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Concurrent Degradation

> "During the five hundred years of Anglo-European colonization, the tribes have seen a progressive shift from gynecentric, egalitarian, ritual-based social systems to secularized structures closely imitative of the European patriarchal system. During this time women (including lesbians) and gay men—along with traditional medicine people, holy people, shamans, and ritual leaders—have suffered severe loss of status, power, and leadership." (p. 259)

### 2. The Grandmothers' Creation Theology

> "Before the coming of the white man, or long ago, so far, as the people say, the Grandmother(s) created the firmament, the earth, and all the spirit beings in it. She (or they) created, by thinking into being, the Women, or the Woman, from whom the people sprang." (p. 266)

### 3. Gender Designation Systems

**Kaska (Canada):**
> "The Kaska of Canada would designate a daughter in a family that had only daughters as a boy. When she was small, around five, her parents would tie a pouch of dried bear ovaries to her belt. She would dress in male clothing and would function in the Kaska male role for the rest of her life." (p. 261)

**Yuma/Mohave:**
- Gender designation based on **dreams**
- A female who dreamed of weapons became male functionally
- The *hwame* (lesbian) took a male name and observed male taboos

### 4. Tribal LGBTQ+ Terms

| Term | Tribe | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| *Alyha* | Mohave | Male homosexual |
| *Hwame* | Mohave | Lesbian |
| *Nadle* | Navajo | — |
| *Winkte* | Lakota | Male homosexual |
| *Koshkalaka* | Lakota | Female homosexual |
| *Joya* | Chumash | "Jewel" |

### 5. Colonial Violence

> "Balboa, for instance, set wild dogs on the Gay medicine men of California tribes, killing them, the 'Jewels' of their own people."

> "Gay people were often the first Indians killed." (p. 263)

### 6. Homophobia-Misogyny Connection

> "It is significant, I think, that those who are homophobic are also very likely to be misogynist. Indeed, the latter often masquerade as the former. The colonizers' treatment of gays is analogous to their treatment of healers, holy people, dreamers, and other traditional leaders, foremost among whom have traditionally been the women." (p. 265)
