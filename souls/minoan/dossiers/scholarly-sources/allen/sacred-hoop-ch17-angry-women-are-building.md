## Overview

This chapter addresses **contemporary struggles facing American Indian women**—centering on literal and cultural survival in the face of ongoing genocide.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Documents mechanisms of cultural destruction including violence against women and image control. Greek mythology may function as "image control" suppressing Minoan women's power—recasting them as monsters, traitors, or objects.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Survival as Central Issue

> "The central issue that confronts American Indian women throughout the hemisphere is survival, literal survival, both on a cultural and biological level." (p. 252)

**Statistics:**
- Population ~1 million (from est. 20-45 million pre-contact)
- Average life expectancy: 55 years
- Unemployment: 60-90%
- ~25% of women sterilized without informed consent

### 2. Violence Against Women

*Navajo Times* headline (fall 1979): Rape was number one crime on Navajo reservation

Phyllis Old Dog Cross: "At least 80 percent of the Native Women seen at the regional psychiatric service center have experienced some sort of sexual assault."

### 3. Image Control as Weapon

> "Image casting and image control constitute the central process that American Indian women must come to terms with, for on that control rests our sense of self, our claim to a past and to a future that we define and that we build." (p. 256)

The Hitler principle: "If you tell a lie big enough and often enough, it will be believed."

### 4. The Grandmothers' Return

> "When Grandmother returns (and she's coming soon) we want to be ready; we intend to be ready. We are recovering our heritage and uncovering the history of colonization—the history of gynocide that weakened the tribes almost to death." (p. 251)
