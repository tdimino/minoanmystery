## Overview

This autobiographical chapter presents Allen's personal testimony navigating between tribal and Western definitions of womanhood. It demonstrates how goddess traditions survive through oral transmission even under colonization.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter shows how oral tradition transmits goddess knowledge across generations despite patriarchal suppression. The Keres as "last extreme mother-right people" provides a living model for interpreting archaeological evidence of gynocratic societies.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Tribal vs. Western Images of Women

**Western (Christian):**
> "In the west, few images of women form part of the cultural mythos, and these are largely sexually charged. Among Christians, the madonna is the female prototype, and she is portrayed as essentially passive: her contribution is simply that of birthing." (p. 68)

The dichotomy: Madonna vs. witch-goddess/whore—"designed to reinforce cultural beliefs about women."

**Tribal:**
> "The tribes see women variously, but they do not question the power of femininity. Sometimes they see women as fearful, sometimes peaceful, sometimes omnipotent and omniscient, but they never portray women as mindless, helpless, simple, or oppressed." (p. 69)

### 2. Sacred Female Figures in Allen's Heritage

| Figure | Tribe | Attributes |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **White Buffalo Woman** | Lakota | Brought Sacred Pipe religion |
| **Tinotzin** (Guadalupe) | Aztec | "Still walked the hills of her people" |
| **Yellow Woman** | Laguna | Ritual agent |
| **Coyote Woman** | Laguna | Trickster aspect |
| **Grandmother Spider** | Keres | "Brought the light, gave us weaving and medicine" |
| **Thought Woman** | Keres | "Created us all and keeps us in creation" |
| **Iyatiku** (Earth/Corn Woman) | Keres | "Guides and counsels the people to peace" |
| **Sun Woman** | Keres | Iyatiku's sister; "went away to the east" |

### 3. Menstrual Power (Reframing "Taboos")

**Western interpretation**: Indians "barred menstruating women from ceremonies... considered them unclean."

**Tribal understanding:**
> "The truth of the matter as many Indians see it is that women who are at the peak of their fecundity are believed to possess power that throws male power totally out of kilter." (p. 73)

**Menstrual power examples:**
- Disempowers Lakota *yuwipi* healer
- Many ceremonies require women's presence
- Different rituals require different feminine states
- "Power to kill with a glance, with a step, or with a judicious mixing of menstrual blood"

### 4. Keres as "Mother-Right People"

> "Of course, my mother's Laguna people are Keres Indian, reputed to be the last extreme mother-right people on earth." (p. 74)

**Keres feminine ideals:**
- Physical strength as virtue
- Self-reliance and competence
- "Notably nonwhite notions about the natural strength and prowess of women"

### 5. Oral Tradition as Survival

> "Since the coming of the Anglo-Europeans beginning in the fifteenth century, the fragile web of identity that long held tribal people secure has gradually been weakened and torn. But the oral tradition has prevented the complete destruction of the web." (p. 71)

**Transmission through stories:**
> "My mother told me stories all the time... In all of those stories she told me who I was, who I was supposed to be, whom I came from, and who would follow me." (p. 71)
