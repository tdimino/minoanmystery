## Overview

This chapter examines how **American Indian women poets navigate between genocide and continuance**—bearing witness to destruction while affirming ongoing existence.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Illuminates how conquered peoples process catastrophe. The "transformation" of Minoan into Greek religion may have been experienced as survival strategy. Daedalus as trickster may preserve Minoan coping with conquest.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Love and Death as Twin Themes

> "In the ancient bardic tradition the bards sang only of love and death. Certainly these twin themes encompass the whole of human experience." (p. 213)

For Indian women poets:
- **Love**: bonding, celebration, connection
- **Death**: genocide, extinction, destruction

### 2. Pervasive Genocide Awareness

> "The impact of genocide in the minds of American Indian poets and writers cannot be exaggerated. It is a pervasive feature of the consciousness of every American Indian in the United States." (p. 213)

Mary TallMountain: "Yes, I said. / I know what they have done."

### 3. Question of Survival

> "How does one survive in the face of collective death?" (p. 214)

**Responses:**
- Bearing witness
- Transformation
- Humor
- Continuance

### 4. Humor as Survival

> "Humor is widely used by Indians to deal with life. Indian gatherings are marked by laughter and jokes, many directed at the horrors of history." (p. 216)

**Coyote as metaphor:**
> "Coyote survives. He survives partly out of luck, partly out of cunning, and partly because he has, beneath a scabby coat, such great creative prowess." (p. 217)
