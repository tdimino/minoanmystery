## Overview

This chapter explores **tribal concept of time as timelessness**—ceremonial time differs fundamentally from Western linear chronology.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Non-linear time in ritual cultures. Minoan palace calendrical systems may have measured ceremonial rather than chronological time. The "destructions" may be ceremonial events, not historical disasters.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Time as Timelessness

> "The traditional tribal concept of time is of timelessness, as the concept of space is of multidimensionality. In the ceremonial world the tribes inhabit, time and space are mythic." (p. 203)

Fred Young (Navajo physicist):
> "If you held time constant, space went to infinity, and when space was held constant, time moved to infinity." (p. 203)

### 2. Achronology in Literature

> "Achronology is the favored structuring device of American Indian novelists since N. Scott Momaday selected it for organizing *House Made of Dawn*." (p. 203)

**Characteristics:**
- Events not chronological
- Past has "immediate bearing" on present
- Personal and collective history interpenetrate
- Protagonist moves through time, not just space

### 3. "Humma Haa"

> "Lagunas start their stories by saying 'humma haa,' which means 'long ago, so far,' among other things." (p. 212)

**The phrase captures:**
- Temporal distance ("long ago")
- Spatial distance ("so far")
- Ongoing presence (happening now)

### 4. Indian Time as Propriety

> "Ultimately, Indian time is a concept based on a sense of propriety, on a ritual understanding of order and harmony." (p. 211)

Fittingness = "how the person meshes with the revolving of the seasons, the land, and the mythic reality"
