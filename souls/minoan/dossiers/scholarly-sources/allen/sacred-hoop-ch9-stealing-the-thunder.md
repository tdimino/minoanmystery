## Overview

This concluding chapter articulates Allen's vision for **shifting American Indian literary studies from a male to a female axis**—transforming the entire field from narratives of extinction to narratives of continuance.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: The continuance thesis is Allen's most important contribution—shifting from "collapse" to "survival" narratives. Greek sources frame Minoan civilization as destroyed; a feminine-centered reading reveals continuance.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Continuance vs. Extinction

> "Strange things begin to happen when the focus in American Indian literary studies is shifted from a male to a female axis. One of the major results of the shift is that the materials become centered on continuance rather than on extinction." (p. 347)

> "One wonders if the focus on male traditions and history that has characterized the whole field of American Indian literature and lore was not part of the plot to exterminate Native American tribal peoples." (p. 347)

### 2. The Invisible She

> "However he is viewed—sympathetically or with suspicion and terror—the Indian is always he." (p. 348)

**What "she" never does in American memory:**
- Rides tall in the saddle
- Parlays with the white man
- Dies at Sand Creek or Wounded Knee
- Stands as shaman giving advice

### 3. The Shift in Divine Names

**From:** Great Spirit
**To:** Thought Woman, Sky Woman, Cihuacoatl, Selu

> "Theirs as 'the name of god'"

### 4. Context as Female, Context as God

> "In the Keres way, context is female and it is God, because it is the source and generator of meaning." (p. 355)

**The deicide sequence:**
- Vanished context = meaningless data
- Vanished context = vanished God
- Destroying context = destroying women
- Destroying context = destroying a race
- **Destroying context = Deicide**

### 5. Male vs. Female Principles

| Male Principle | Female Principle |
|----------------|------------------|
| Transitory | Permanent |
| Dies and reconstitutes | Remains |
| Breath, air, wind | Hard substances: earth, minerals, stones |
| Feathers, smoke, lightning | Wood, water, corn |
| Wandering, risk | Continuance, stability |

> "The male principle is transitory; it dies and is reconstituted. The female principle, which is immanent in hard substances... is permanent; it remains." (p. 353)

### 6. The Redemptive Realization

> "When we shift our attention from the male, the transitory, to the female, the enduring, we realize that the Indians are not doomed to extinction but rather are fated to endure. What a redemptive, empowering realization that is!" (p. 354)

**The Cheyenne saying:** "No people is broken until the heart of its women is on the ground. Then they are broken. Then will they die."
