## Overview

This chapter examines **alienation in American Indian literature**—how colonization creates estrangement from identity, community, and land.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Illuminates psychology of colonized peoples. Minoans surviving under Mycenaean rule may have experienced similar alienation—strangers in their own palaces. Greek myths about Crete may preserve traces of this experience.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Belonging as Fundamental Assumption

> "Belonging is a basic assumption for traditional Indians, and estrangement is seen as so abnormal that narratives and rituals that restore the estranged to his or her place within the cultural matrix abound." (p. 177)

**Traditional worldview:**
- Belonging is assumed, not earned
- Estrangement seen as abnormal
- Narratives/rituals exist to restore the estranged

### 2. Wholeness as Primary Thrust

> "The primary thrust of traditional narratives and chants is wholeness because relationship is taken as fundamental to creaturely existence." (p. 177)

**Key insight:**
- Relationship = fundamental to existence
- Wholeness = primary purpose of narrative
- Integration, not alienation, is normative

### 3. Classic Dimensions of Alienation

> "The contemporary Indian writer's preoccupation with alienation in its classic dimensions of isolation, powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, lowered self-esteem, and self-estrangement, accompanied by anxiety, hopelessness, and victimization." (p. 180)

**Types of alienation:**
- Isolation and powerlessness
- Meaninglessness and normlessness
- Lowered self-esteem
- Self-estrangement
- Anxiety, hopelessness, victimization

### 4. Exclusion as Maiming

> "When belonging is a central value, the excluded, who are likely to feel keenly the importance of the value in question, are necessarily maimed by separation." (p. 181)

**The paradox:**
- Those who value belonging most feel exclusion most keenly
- Exclusion becomes a form of wounding/maiming
- Literature expresses this pain of outsiderhood

### 5. Literature as Response

**Documentation:** Recording the experience of displacement

**Recovery:** Reconnecting with traditions through writing

**Resistance:** Refusing complete assimilation
