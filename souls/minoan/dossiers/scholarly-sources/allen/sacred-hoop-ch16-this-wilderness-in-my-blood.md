## Overview

This chapter examines the **spiritual foundations** of American Indian women's poetry—a "spirit-informed view of the universe" as primary perceptual characteristic.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Spirit-based art and vision. Minoan artists may have worked with similar awareness of spirit presence—images as points of contact with spirit world, not decoration. The "wilderness in the blood" parallel to Minoan reverence for wild nature.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Spirit-Based Vision

> "American Indian women writers have as our first and most significant perceptual characteristic a solid, impregnable, and ineradicable orientation toward a spirit-informed view of the universe." (p. 225)

**This view is:**
- Not private but shared by tribal reality
- Not personal but reaching beyond individual
- Subjective but derived from oral tradition

### 2. Joy Harjo: Spirit People Crowded Around

> "The spirit people are all around her, crowded around, when she writes. 'Sometimes,' she says, 'I can almost see them. And my work is powerful when I'm able to see them.'" (p. 226)

On polarity and unity:
> "I have a sense of how I keep going deeper and deeper... like the center of the earth like a star, which is really the outside but it's the inside." (p. 226)

### 3. The Moon as Circuit

Harjo: "Poems are like circuits... a place, it's a poem, like a globular, like a circle with center points all over."

### 4. The Wilderness Within

> "There is a permanent wilderness in the blood of an Indian, a wilderness that will endure as long as the grass grows, the wind blows, the rivers flow, and one Indian woman remains alive." (p. 248)
