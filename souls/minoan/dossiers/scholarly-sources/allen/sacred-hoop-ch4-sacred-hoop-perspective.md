## Overview

This title chapter articulates fundamental **cosmological differences** between Native American and Judeo-Christian worldviews. Essential for understanding gynocratic theology vs. patriarchal systems.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the theoretical framework for understanding pre-patriarchal cosmology—cooperative creation, cyclical time, relational (not hierarchical) reality. The shift from Minoan to Greek religion may parallel the cosmological transition Allen describes.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Medicine Wheel / Sacred Hoop

> "This idea is apparent in the Plains tribes' idea of a medicine wheel or sacred hoop. The concept is one of singular unity that is dynamic and encompassing, including all that is contained in its most essential aspect, that of life." (p. 82)

**Attributes:**
- Dynamic, not static
- Encompassing unity
- All things are living, aware, related
- Participatory creation

### 2. Cooperative vs. Hierarchical Creation

**Cheyenne Maheo:**
> "Maheo... 'You have made us sky and light to fly in, and you have made us water to swim in... Give us a place to build our nests, please, Maheo.'
>
> 'So be it,' answered Maheo, 'but to make such a place I must have your help, all of you. By myself, I have made four things... Now I must have help if I am to create more, for my Power will only let me make four things by myself.'"

**Maheo's nature:**
- Has limited power
- Possesses "a sense of proportion and respect for the powers of the creatures"
- Requires cooperation to continue creation
- Is "all about" creatures, not separate

**Judeo-Christian contrast:**
> "Contrast this spirit with the Judeo-Christian God, who makes everything and tells everything how it may and may not function if it is to gain his respect and blessing." (p. 84)

### 3. Two Cosmological Models

| Feature | American Indian | Judeo-Christian |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Universe** | Dynamic, living | Static, fixed |
| **Space** | Spherical | Linear |
| **Time** | Cyclical | Sequential |
| **Hierarchy** | Egalitarian/relational | Vertical/command |
| **Significance** | Inherent in being | Placement on scale |
| **Creation** | Cooperative, ongoing | Complete, commanded |
| **Spirit/Matter** | Unified | Dualistic |
| **Intelligence** | Attribute of all being | Unique to humans/God |

### 4. Wholeness as Core Value

> "The natural state of existence is whole. Thus healing chants and ceremonies emphasize restoration of wholeness, for disease is a condition of division and separation from the harmony of the whole. Beauty is wholeness. Health is wholeness. Goodness is wholeness." (p. 88)

**Hopi "two-hearts":**
> "The Hopi refer to a witch—a person who uses the powers of the universe in a perverse or inharmonious way—as a two-hearts, one who is not whole but is split in two at the center of being." (p. 89)

### 5. Breath as Life Principle

Keres song:
> I add my breath to your breath / That our days may be long on the Earth / That the days of our people may be long / That we may be one person / That we may finish our roads together / May our mother bless you with life / May our Life Paths be fulfilled.

> "Breath is life, and the intermingling of breaths is the purpose of good living." (p. 82)
