## Overview

This chapter argues that **American feminism has Native American roots**—the dream of women's equality and just government derives directly from observation of gynocratic tribal confederacies, particularly the Iroquois.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Documents how gynocratic governance actually functioned—with women's councils, clan matrons, and constitutional protections. Provides a living template for understanding what Minoan palace governance may have looked like.

## Key Arguments

### 1. "Who Is Your Mother?"

> "At Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, 'Who is your mother?' is an important question. At Laguna, one of several of the ancient Keres gynocratic societies of the region, your mother's identity is the key to your own identity." (p. 278)

> "Failure to know your mother, that is, your position and its attendant traditions, history, and place in the scheme of things, is failure to remember your significance, your reality, your right relationship to earth and society." (p. 278)

### 2. Memory vs. Forgetting

| Native American | American |
|-----------------|----------|
| Value maintenance of tradition | Reject and repudiate origins |
| Remember collective past | Forget as quickly as possible |
| Continuity provides identity | History is of little value |

> "The root of oppression is loss of memory." (p. 278)

### 3. The Iroquois Constitution

> "The lineal descent of the people of the Five Fires [the Iroquois Nations] shall run in the female line. Women shall be considered the progenitors of the Nation. They shall own the land and the soil. Men and women shall follow the status of their mothers." (Article 44) (p. 282)

**Governance structure:**
- **Executive**: Council of Matrons (instituted policy)
- **Legislative**: Village, tribal, and Confederate councils
- **Judicial**: Men's councils and Matrons' council together

### 4. The First Feminist Rebellion (c. 1600)

> "It was women who fought what may have been the first successful feminist rebellion in the New World. The year was 1600, or thereabouts, when these tribal feminists decided that they had had enough of unregulated warfare by their men." (p. 405)

**The action:**
- Women proclaimed a boycott on lovemaking and childbearing
- "Until the men conceded to them the power to decide upon war and peace, there would be no more warriors"
- "The rebellion was instantly successful"

### 5. Seneca Falls Connection

> "The footnote of history was curiously supplied when Susan B. Anthony began her 'Votes for Women' movement two and a half centuries later. Unknowingly the feminists chose to hold their founding convention of latter-day suffragettes in the town of Seneca [Falls], New York. The site was just a stone's throw from the old council house where the Iroquois women had plotted their feminist rebellion." (p. 283)

### 6. Influence on Marx and Engels

> "Ethnographer Lewis Henry Morgan wrote an account of Iroquoian matriarchal culture, published in 1877, that heavily influenced Marx and the development of communism, particularly lending it the idea of the liberation of women from patriarchal dominance." (p. 293)
