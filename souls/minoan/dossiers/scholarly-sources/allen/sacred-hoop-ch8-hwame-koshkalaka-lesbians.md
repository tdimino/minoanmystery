## Overview

This chapter explores **lesbianism within tribal spiritual and social contexts**—arguing that same-sex relationships among women were embedded in systems of Spirit-direction, clan belonging, and feminine power.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: Provides framework for understanding **same-sex bonding and ceremonial roles** in goddess-centered cultures. The "ceremonial lesbian" model suggests ritual roles for women whose primary allegiance was to the goddess rather than to husbands—relevant to understanding Minoan priestess communities.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Invisibility Problem

> "The lesbian is to the American Indian what the Indian is to the American—invisible." (p. 326)

Near-total absence in ethnographic literature—not because it didn't exist, but because:
- Patriarchal interpreters couldn't see it
- Categories for understanding it were lacking

### 2. Spirit-Based Kinship

> "Among American Indians, Spirit-related persons are perceived as more closely linked than blood-related persons." (p. 329)

Primary value = relationship to Spirit world. All institutions determined by this understanding.

### 3. Menstrual Power (Reframing "Taboos")

**Western interpretation (Ortner):**
- Menstruation = "contamination"
- Women prohibited from ceremonies = low status

**Tribal understanding:**
> "Tribal people view menstruation as a 'medicine' of such power that it can cause the death of certain people, such as men on the eve of combat, or pregnant women." (p. 336)

### 4. Structural Conditions for Lesbianism

Women spent great amounts of time together:
- Weeks in menstrual huts
- Joint work (tilling, harvesting, grinding)
- Months/years during initiation

> "In such circumstances, lesbianism and homosexuality were probably commonplace. Indeed, same-sex relationships may have been the norm for primary pair-bonding." (p. 341)

### 5. Two Types of Lesbian Women

**"Lesbian"**: Women who formed erotic bonds based on personal preference

**"Dyke" / Ceremonial Lesbian**:
> "The dyke... was likely to have been a medicine woman in a special sense. She probably was a participant in the Spirit (intelligence, force field) of an Entity or Deity who was particularly close to earth during the Goddess period." (p. 342)

### 6. Signs of the Goddess

> "Signs of this Deity remain scattered all over the continent: Snake Mound in Ohio is probably one. La Virgin de Guadalupe is another." (p. 342)
