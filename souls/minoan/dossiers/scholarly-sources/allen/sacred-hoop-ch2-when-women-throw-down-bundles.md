## Overview

This chapter documents the **systematic destruction of gynocratic Native American societies** through colonization. It provides detailed historical evidence of how patriarchalization was deliberately imposed to facilitate conquest.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This is a documented case study of gynocide—the deliberate destruction of woman-centered societies. The mechanisms documented here (colonial dismissal, legal disenfranchisement, religious conversion, internal agents) may have operated similarly in the Bronze Age Mediterranean transition from goddess-centered to patriarchal systems.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Gynocide as Colonial Strategy

> "Destruction of the institutions rested on the overthrow or subversion of the gynocratic nature of the tribal system, as documents and offhand comments by white interveners attest." (p. 53)

### 2. "Petticoat Government" Evidence

**Cherokee Women's Council powers:**
- **Women's Council** made policy decisions
- **Beloved Woman** spoke with voice of Great Spirit
- Power to decide fate of captives
- Right to wage war
- **War Women** and **Peace Women** held offices
- Right to speak in men's Council
- Right to choose marriage
- Right to bear arms

**Penalty differential:** Killing a woman = **double penalty** vs. killing a man (Iroquoian peoples)

### 3. Women Chiefs (Sunksquaws)

Robert Grumet documented numerous **women heads of state** among Mid-Atlantic Coastal Algonkians:

| Name | Nation | Period | Notable Facts |
|------|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Queene of Appamatuck** | Sachem | 1600s | Present at John Smith council |
| **Massachusetts Queen** | Massachusetts Confederacy | pre-1620 | Presided over Confederacy |
| **Magnus** | Narragansett | 1600s | Executed with 90 others |
| **Weetamoo** | Pocasset | 1600s | War chief, 300 warriors |
| **Awashonks** | Sakonnet | late 1600s | Saved warriors from enslavement |
| **Empress of Accomack** | — | 1673 | "Sat in council" |
| **Queens of Pungoteque & Nanduye** | — | 1705 | Nanduye had nations "under Tribute" |

### 4. Scholarly Erasure

Grumet's key observation:

> "Ethnohistorians have traditionally assigned male gender to native figures in the documentary record unless otherwise identified. They have also tended to not identify native individuals as leaders unless so identified in the specific source." (p. 58)

Allen's expansion: "It falsifies the record of people who are not able to set it straight; it reinforces patriarchal socialization among all Americans."

### 5. The Handsome Lake Code (Internal Patriarchalization)

Seneca prophet Handsome Lake's reforms (early 19th century):
- Characterized Matrons as "meddling old women"
- Advocated women cleave to husbands over mothers
- Promoted abandonment of clan-mother-controlled longhouse
- Established patriarchal nuclear family

> "Under the Code of Handsome Lake, which was the tribal version of the white man's way, the Longhouse declined in importance, and eventually Iroquois women were firmly under the thumb of Christian patriarchy." (p. 55)

### 6. Cherokee Constitution (Legal Disenfranchisement)

In effort to prevent Removal (early 1800s):

> "The Cherokee in the early 1800s, under the leadership of men such as Elias Boudinot, Major Ridge, and John Ross... drafted a constitution that disenfranchised women and blacks. Modeled after the Constitution of the United States... the new Cherokee constitution relegated women to the position of chattel." (p. 60)
