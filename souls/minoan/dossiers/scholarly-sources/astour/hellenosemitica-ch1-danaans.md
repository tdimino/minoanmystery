## Overview

This opening chapter establishes Astour's central thesis: that the Greek Danaans (*Danaoi*) and the Cilician Danunians (*Dnnym*) share more than a coincidental name—they share West Semitic origins. Astour marshals evidence from the Karatepe inscription, Amarna letters, Egyptian sources, and East Cilician toponymics to demonstrate that the Danunians were indigenous West Semites, not Greek colonizers. He then analyzes the Greek mythological figure Danaos alongside the Ugaritic hero Danel (*Dnil*) to show functional parallels that point to a common Semitic origin.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the foundational argument that Greek civilization's mythological ancestry (the Danaans/Danaoi of Homer) traces back to Semitic populations in the Eastern Mediterranean—a key pillar of the Hellenosemitic thesis.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Karatepe Discovery and the Danunians (pp. 1–30)

The 1946 discovery of the Karatepe bilingual inscription (Phoenician and Hieroglyphic Luwian) by H. T. Bossert revealed a kingdom of "Danunians" (*Dnnym*) in Eastern Cilicia, ruled by the "House of Mopsos" (*Bt-Mps*). This discovery ignited debate about whether the Danunians were:

- Anatolian natives
- Greek colonizers (Danaans from Greece)
- West Semitic inhabitants

Astour argues decisively for the West Semitic option based on:

1. **The Phoenician language** of the inscription itself
2. **Semitic divine names** in the royal pantheon (Baal, El, Reshef)
3. **Semitic toponymics** throughout Eastern Cilicia
4. **The name Danuna** itself, which has clear West Semitic formation

> "The numerous scholars who have studied the Karatepe inscription and the problems connected with it have not considered the possibility of a Semitic character in the name Danuna, borne by the inhabitants of that country—the Danunians. If the name Danuna had been discovered not in Palestine, there would hardly have been any doubts about its purely West-Semitic (W-S) origin." (p. 61)

### 2. Semitic Character of the Name "Danuna" (pp. 61–75)

Astour demonstrates that *Danuna* has transparent West Semitic morphology:

- **Root**: *dān* (W-S "to judge")—cognate with Hebrew tribe of *Dān*, Ugaritic sage *Dnil* (Daniel), and Amarna personal name *Danuna* (EA 117:92)
- **Suffix**: *-una/-ana*—the standard W-S gentilic ending (cf. *Ṣidōn* < *Ṣidūna*, *'Ašqelōn* < *'Ašqalūna*)

The name follows the same pattern as Palestinian toponyms preserved in the Amarna letters:

| Amarna Form | Biblical Form |
|-------------|---------------|
| *A-ia-lu-na* | *'Ayyālôn* |
| *Aš-qa-lu-na* | *'Ašqelôn* |
| *Zi-du-na* | *Ṣidôn* |
| *Sa-ru-na* | *Šārôn* |

> "Thus the W-S name *Danuna* is not just a hypothetical construction: it is actually found in EA 117:92 as a personal name; and it is known that W-S names of towns and tribes were often formed after the same models as those of persons and frequently coincided with them." (p. 72)

### 3. Evidence from East Cilician Toponymics (pp. 46–60)

Drawing on king Idri-mi of Alalah's campaign records and Hittite delimitation treaties, Astour identifies numerous Semitic place-names in Eastern Cilicia:

**From Idri-mi's campaign (~1500 BCE):**
- *Ṣa-ru-na*: W-S root *ṣar* "narrow" (cf. *Šārôn*)
- *I-e*: Hebrew *'î* "island, coast-land"
- *Da-ma-ru-ut-re*: Semitic *damara*

**Adana itself:**
> "The name *'dn*, preserved up to this day as Adana, is also Semitic and derives from *'adân* 'lord' (which became in South Canaanite, including Hebrew, *'ādōn*)—a frequent divine title, especially well known by the Greco-Phoenician Adonis." (p. 40)

The evidence shows that Eastern Cilicia had the same mixed Hurrian-Semitic population as North Syria (Ugarit, Alalah).

### 4. The Mopsos Problem (pp. 75–90)

Astour addresses the presence of the "House of Mopsos" (*Bt-Mps*), which some scholars cite as proof of Greek colonization. He demonstrates that Mopsos was:

1. **Not exclusively Greek**—the name appears in Lydian, Thessalian, and Anatolian contexts
2. **Originally Anatolian**—the form *Muksas* in Hieroglyphic Luwian suggests an Asianic name
3. **Retrojected**—Greek legends about Mopsos founding Cilician cities arose *after* Greek colonization (~700 BCE), not before

> "Thessalian *Mopsion*, Ionian Claros and Colophon, Lydia, Phrygia, Cabalia, Attica, Libya, Pamphylia, Lycian Phaselis, Palestinian Ascalon, Cilician Mallos—is it not too wide an arena for one life, are not there too many cities founded for one man?" (p. 86)

### 5. Danaos and Danel: Mythological Parallel (pp. 91–112)

Astour's most innovative argument compares the Greek eponymous hero Danaos with the Ugaritic hero Danel (*Dnil*), protagonist of the Aqhat epic:

**Functional Parallels:**

| Danel (Ugaritic) | Danaos (Greek) |
|------------------|----------------|
| Healer (*mtrpi*), judge, soothsayer | King who brought fertility to Argos |
| Daughter Pǵt "who shoulders water, spreads dew on barley" | Daughters (Danaides) who "watered the country," found springs |
| Pǵt arms herself with dagger for vengeance | Danaides armed with daggers, kill husbands |
| Connected with agricultural cycles | Daughters introduced Thesmophoria (Demeter's feast) |

> "The Argive Danaos is an analogous character—to judge from the relics in the myth. He and his daughters brought fertility to the Argive plain. His daughters found springs, and to them was also ascribed the introduction of the Thesmophoria." (p. 100)

The Hebrew tribe of Dan also connects to this complex through the Blessing of Jacob: "Dan will judge his people" (Gen. 49:16) and his serpent symbolism (Gen. 49:17)—matching Danel's chthonic, agrarian character.

### 6. Linguistic Hellenization of *Danuna* (pp. 70–75)

Astour explains how the Semitic *Danuna* became Greek *Danaoi*:

- Original: *Dān* + *-una* (W-S gentilic suffix)
- Hellenized: *Dān* + *-awoi* (I-E suffix of belonging)
- Result: *Danawoi* > *Danaoi*

This follows the same pattern as Hittite *Adanawa* ("that of Adana") and is confirmed by Mycenaean tablets where names ending in *-aos* are spelled *-awo-*.

> "Thus the Gr. *Dana(w)oi* is a regular Hellenization of the Semitic ethnic name *Danuna* by way of replacing its gentilic ending *-una* (or *-ana*) with the Indo-European equivalent suffix *-aw-*." (p. 75)

## Notable Passages

> "The conclusion from all these toponymic data is evident. The place-names of Eastern Cilicia in the second millennium were Hurrian, Akkadian and W-S, and they survived far into the first millennium. There is no difference, in this respect too, between Eastern Cilicia and the North Syrian states of Alalah and Ugarit." (p. 59)

> "Since the Cilician Danunians could not have come from Greece, according to archaeologic and epigraphic data, the question of their relationship to the Greek Danaans can be settled only in one of two directions: either they had no more in common than, e.g., the Danaans and the Indian serpent demons *Dánavás*; or, if they actually were related, the ancestors of the Greek Danaans must have come to Greece from the Semitic East." (p. 75)

> "In our approach to the Danaos myth, we shall not begin by another attempt to reinterpret it as an historical relation... We should like to put the question in this way: if the Argive Danaans really had come from the Semitic East, and if the myth about their eponym Danaos really had been born among the Danaans themselves, then this myth must have had a close analogy to the W-S myths which were told in Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine about the hero whose name the Cilician Danunians bore." (p. 91)
