## Overview

This methodological manifesto, published a year before *Hellenosemitica*, establishes Astour's three key analytical methods: the **method of doublets** (borrowed from Victor Bérard), **functional parallelism** (names must match in mythological role, not just sound), and the **method of vestiges** (traces of older myths preserved in later versions). The article demonstrates these methods through two extended case studies: Membliaros/Poikiles as West Semitic cosmogonic terminology, and Cadmos as the West Semitic dawn-deity *qadm* whose entire mythological cycle betrays Semitic origins (Semele = *Ṣml*, Actaeon = *Aqht*, Thebes = *têbâ*, Bakchos = *bākâ*).

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This article provides the essential methodological framework for all of Astour's etymological work. It also explicitly references Cyrus Gordon's Linear A decipherment as "the most important documentary proof of a strong West Semitic element" in Crete.

## Key Arguments

### 1. No Greek Names in Ugaritic Texts (pp. 193–194)

Astour opens by examining whether Greek names appear in second-millennium Ugaritic documents—and finds none:

**Early misidentifications**:
- *Nqmd* ≠ Greek Nikomédés (actually W-S "Hadd is the avenger")
- *Yman* ≠ Ionia (actually a region in Syria "where there are buffaloes by myriads")
- *Ddmš* ≠ epithet of Apollo Didymaeus (actually a distinct Hurrian goddess)

**Ethnic names in Ugaritic texts** include: "Assyrians, Egyptians, Subaraeans, Mitannites, Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Nuhaššeans, Alašiots, and natives of several Phoenician and Palestinian cities. One Lycian (*bn lky*) figures in a Ugaritic tablet, but there is no mention of any natives of the Aegean."

> "These indications are quite precise. They do not confirm the existence of a permanent Mycenaean settlement at Ugarit... In the second millennium B.C. the trend of influence seems to have followed the opposite direction." (p. 194)

### 2. Semitic Names in Linear B Tablets (p. 194)

While predominantly Greek, the Mycenaean tablets contain several Semitic-sounding names:

| Linear B Name | Possible W-S Etymology |
|---------------|------------------------|
| *Misirajo, Aikupitijo* | "Egyptian" |
| *Arasijo* | Alašiot (Cypriot) |
| *Aradajo* | From Arados/Arwad (Phoenicia) |
| *Perita, Periteu* | Gentilics from Berit (Beirut) |
| *Turijajo, Turijo* | From Tyre |
| *Anateu* | From goddess Anath |
| *Apareи* (= Aphareus) | W-S *'äphär* "dust" |
| *Kadano* | = Ugaritic *Kdn*, from Akk. *kadânu* "to protect" |

### 3. Gordon's Linear A Decipherment (p. 194)

Astour endorses Gordon's findings:

> "Dr. Cyrus H. Gordon has proved that the Linear A tablets from Hagia Triada were composed in a West Semitic language influenced by Akkadian—the principal literary language of the second millennium East Mediterranean. This... serve[s] as the most important documentary proof of a strong West Semitic element in at least one region of the Aegean, namely its main cultural center, the island of Crete."

### 4. Victor Bérard and the Method of Doublets (pp. 194–196)

Astour rehabilitates Bérard against the Beloch school that dominated since the 1890s:

**The method of doublets**: When a locality has two names—one Greek, one non-Greek—and the Greek is an exact translation of the non-Greek, this proves the non-Greek origin.

**Example**: *Rheneia* (from Heb. *ränan* "to shout") was also called *Keladussa* ("tumultuous, shouting")—semantic doublet confirmed.

### 5. Membliaros and Cosmogonic Terminology (pp. 196–198)

Astour's first extended demonstration of methodology:

**The name**: *Membliaros* = W-S *mêm-bli-'âr* = "waters without light"

**Functional confirmation** (Apollonius Rhodius, *Argonautica* IV.1694–98):
> "Night scared them, that night which they name the Pall of Darkness; the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams of the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven."

This description of cosmogonic darkness occurs precisely when the Argonauts approach Anaphe-Membliaros.

**Poikiles** (Membliaros's father) = W-S *pî-kôl* "womb of all"

**Combined formula**: *mêm-bli-'âr pî-kôl* = "dark water, the womb of all"—matching Phoenician and Orphic cosmogony exactly.

### 6. Cadmos and the Cadmean Cycle (pp. 198–200)

Astour's second extended demonstration:

**Cadmos** = W-S *qadm* "East/Dawn"

**Europa** = W-S *'arôb šamši* "sunset" (attested in Ugaritic god-lists as *'rb špš*)

**Functional parallel**: *Cadmos/Europa* = *Šhr/Šlm* (Ugaritic Dawn and Dusk deities)

**Cadmos's serpent-transformation**: Matches Ningišzida—Sumerian serpent-god of dawn, dragon-slayer, city-founder

**Harmonia**: W-S *'Armônîyâ* from *'armôn* "palace" = Ugaritic *B'lt-bhtm* "Lady of the Palace"

**Semele** = Ugaritic *Ṣml* "Mother of the Eagles"

**Actaeon** = *Aqht* + suffix *-iyyôn*—both dismembered for offending a goddess about hunting

**Pentheus** = Greek *penthos* "mourning" = semantic doublet of *Bakchos* (from *bākâ* "to weep")

**Bassarids** = from *bāṣar* "to tear to pieces"

**Thebes** (*Thêba*) = Heb. *têbâ* "ark"—confirmed by Ogygos flood myth

**Ladon** (Theban river from dragon's blood) = Ugaritic dragon *Ltn* (Leviathan)

### 7. Methodology Summary (pp. 195–196)

Astour's three methods:

1. **Method of Doublets**: Parallel toponyms (Greek translation + non-Greek original)
2. **Functional Parallelism**: Names must match in mythological role, not just sound
3. **Method of Vestiges**: Details "redundant or inexplicable in its present form but quite normal and understandable in a different, older version"

> "Simple similarity of names taken in itself may be fortuitous; similarity of mythical motifs may also be due to independent parallel development. But both factors found together cannot be accidental." (p. 195)

## Notable Passages

> "Archeology reveals ancient and continuing contacts between the world of the Aegeans and the cultural sphere of the West Semites... But archeology cannot answer all aspects of this question. It informs us about architecture, ceramics, painting, glyptic art, but it is of little help in establishing the scope of ethnic and cultural impacts." (p. 193)

> "The reaction against this trend arose in Germany in the eighteen nineties, led by Beloch. This school... soon prevailed in Greek scholarship. It categorically asserted that all reports of Phoenicians in Greece were absolutely baseless, pure fiction or mistakes. The reaction went so far that not only Cadmos, but even Adonis were declared non-Semitic." (p. 195)

> "Only the knowledge of the Semitic prototypes of many important Greek myths, including those of Io, Danaos, Heracles, the Argonauts, Bellerophon, Phaëthon, Asclepios, the daughters of Cecrops, and even the Trojan war and several episodes of the *Odyssey*, permits us to truly estimate the extent of the contribution of Greek genius in developing these Semitic motifs." (p. 200)
