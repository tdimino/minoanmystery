## Overview

This article analyzes a newly published topographical list from Amenhotep III's (1406–1369 BCE) funeral temple at Kom el Hetan, identifying nine toponyms written in Egyptian "group writing" (syllabic orthography). Kitchen had already tentatively identified Knossos and Amnisos; Astour confirms these and extends the identifications to cover all nine names, placing them in Crete, the Peloponnese (Kingdom of Pylos), and Kythera. The article demonstrates that Egyptians of the 14th century BCE knew specific Aegean localities far better than previously supposed, confirming steady connections between Egypt, the Levant, and the Aegean.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This provides direct documentary evidence—from an Egyptian royal inscription—of Bronze Age Egyptian knowledge of specific Minoan and Mycenaean localities, corroborating the archaeological evidence for sustained Aegean-Near Eastern contact.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Kitchen's Initial Identifications (p. 313)

K. A. Kitchen published the inscription from Base C at Kom el Hetan and tentatively identified:
- **Ku-nu-sha** = Knossos (Linear B *ko-no-so*)
- **'A-m-ni-sha** = Amnisos (harbor of Knossos)
- **Ri-ka-ta** = Lyktos (tentatively)

Kitchen hesitated: "Could this list just conceivably be partly Syrian and partly 'Keftiu' (Cretan)? The latter would have to be ports or towns trading with Egypt (construed as tribute)."

Astour's response: "Kitchen had no reason to hesitate in making his absolutely plausible equation."

### 2. Di-qa = Mount Dikte (pp. 314–316)

**Egyptian spelling**: The second syllable is "pleonastically spelled as the Egyptian root *q₃*, 'be high,' combining its two graphic variants... including its determinative 'high.'"

**Linear B confirmation**: *di-ka-ta-de* "to Dikte" (KN Fp 7:2), *di-ka-ta-jo di-we* "to Dictaean Zeus" (KN Fp 1:2)

**The Graeco-Semitic doublet**:
> "Hesiod's (Theogony 484) Aigaion oros, 'Goat's Mountain,' in Crete, where the infant Zeus was raised in a secret holy cave, is evidently identical with the mountain and cave of Dikte. Aigaion oros = Diktê may well be a Graeco-Semitic doublet, for in Ugaritic ritual texts *dqt* (literally, 'small one') was the term for a 'female head of small cattle for sacrifice,' and a goat rather than a sheep."

**Divine name**: "*Dqt* is also found as a divine name in a Ugaritic list of gods (RS 24.246), which reminds us of the goat that nourished Zeus in the Dictaean cave."

### 3. Mi-dja-na = Mezana/Messenia (p. 316)

**Correspondence**: Egyptian *Mi-dja-na-'* = Linear B *me-za-na* from Pylos tablets

**Phonetic match**: "Egyptian *dj* transcribed the Semitic zayin and sade, while the Greek zêta derived from and transcribed the Semitic zayin."

**Location**: Classical Messana (Messénē) in Messenia, "the ancient Kingdom of Pylos"

### 4. Nu-pi-ra-yi = Na-pe-re-wa/Nauplion (p. 316)

**Linear B parallel**: *Na-pe-re-wa*, toponym of the Kingdom of Pylos (PY Cn 868:4)

**Classical parallel**: River Naphilos in Pausanias (8.38.9), "a southern confluent of the Alpheus in the vicinity of Thisoa in southwestern Arcadia, a region definitely included in the Mycenaean age Kingdom of Pylos."

**Postscript**: Albright independently identified Nu-pi-ra-yi with Nauplia, "a port near Tiryns"

### 5. Ku-ti-ra = Kythera (pp. 316–317)

> "Obviously a most exact transcription of Kythera, the island between Crete and the Peloponnese which appears in the Linear B texts from Pylos as the feminine toponymic adjective *ku-te-ra₃* (nom. pl., *ra₃* = *rai*) and *ku-te-ra-o* (gen. pl., *-raón*)."

**Archaeological confirmation**: "As shown by recent excavations, Kythera was a peripheral center of Minoan civilization." Evidence includes an Old Babylonian cuneiform votive inscription and a stone cup with an Egyptian Fifth Dynasty temple name.

### 6. Wa-'l-r(a)-yi = Wa-e-ro (p. 317)

**Linear B parallel**: *Wa-e-ro* (PY Cn 1197:2), "attested in the Kingdom of Pylos"

**Perfect correspondence**: "Its correspondence to *Wa-'l-r(a)-yi* is perfect."

### 7. Ku-nu-sha and 'A-m-ni-sha: Phonetic Analysis (p. 317)

Astour extracts phonetic data from the Egyptian spelling:

> "We have now the name of Knossos written in a script which is phonetically (so far as consonants are concerned) greatly superior to Linear B. We see that its first consonant corresponds to Egyptian *k* (= Semitic kaph), and its last, to Egyptian *sh* (= Semitic 'true' shin)."

**Sea Peoples connection**: The *-sha* ending matches 'A-qi-ya-wa-sha (Ahhiyawa/Achaeans), Tu-ru-sha (Tyrsenians), Sha-k(a)-ru-sha (Sikels), Wa-sha-sha

### 8. Ri-ka-ta = Lyktos (p. 317)

**Phonetic analysis**: The apparent vowel discrepancy (*Ri-ka-ta* vs. *Ru-ki-to*) follows known patterns:

> "Hesitation between *i* and *y(u)* is frequent in pre-Greek names adopted into Greek. In Crete itself, the name of the city of Itanos is spelled *I-ta-nu* in Linear A, but *U-ta-no* in Linear B."

**Semitic transmission pattern**: The form *Likata* follows "a common pattern in Syrian toponymy of the 15th-13th centuries B.C." (cf. Ar-da-ta, Ir-qa-ta, U-ga-ri-ta). The relationship between *Lukto-* and *Likat(a)* is "that between status rectus and status absolutus of a Semitic feminine noun."

### 9. Proposed Restoration: [P]ā-k(i)-'a-nu = Pa-ki-ja-ne (p. 317)

**Tentative identification**: If the lost sign before *w* was *p*, the result would be *[P]ā-k(i)-'a-nu* = Linear B *Pa-ki-ja-ne*, "an important town of the Kingdom of Pylos, frequently mentioned in Linear B tablets."

**Geographic distribution**: "If this is so, four toponyms of the new list would belong to the Kingdom of Pylos, four to Crete, and one to the principal island between the two."

## Notable Passages

> "The importance of the new toponymic list published by Kitchen is very considerable. It is the first Egyptian document mentioning specific localities in the Aegean (besides the general and vague terms 'Hau-nebut' and 'Keftiu'). It proves that the Egyptians were acquainted with Crete, Kythera, and the Peloponnese much better than was hitherto supposed." (p. 317)

> "Aigaion oros = Diktê may well be a Graeco-Semitic doublet, for in Ugaritic ritual texts *dqt* (literally, 'small one') was the term for a 'female head of small cattle for sacrifice.'" (p. 315)

> "The relationship between Lukto- (< **Liktu*?) and Likat(a) is that between status rectus and status absolutus of a Semitic feminine noun (e.g., *shubtu: shubat*, 'seat, dwelling'). Both patterns occur in Syrian toponymy. This does not necessarily mean that the name Lyktos is of Semitic origin; it may simply be due to transmission via cities of the Syro-Phoenician coast." (p. 317)
