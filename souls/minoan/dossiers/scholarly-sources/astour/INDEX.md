# Michael C. Astour (1916–2004)

## Scholar Profile

- **Full Name**: Michael C. Astour (born Mikhail Czertok)
- **Dates**: 1916–2004
- **Affiliation**: Brandeis University (Department of Mediterranean Studies under Cyrus H. Gordon)
- **Training**: Sorbonne, Paris (under Charles Virolleaud, decipherer of Ugaritic)
- **Languages**: Ugaritic, Hebrew, Akkadian, Greek, Hittite, Hurrian, Phoenician, plus modern scholarly languages

## Why Astour Matters for Kothar

Astour represents the fullest realization of the Hellenosemitic thesis—the argument that Mycenaean Greek civilization was profoundly shaped by West Semitic cultural influence during the Bronze Age. His work provides Kothar with:

1. **Etymological bridges** between Greek and Semitic divine/heroic names (Cadmos = *qadm*, Semele = *Ṣml*)
2. **Functional parallels** demonstrating that Greek myths borrowed not just names but narrative structures from Ugarit
3. **Archaeological context** for Semitic presence in the Aegean (Linear A, Minoan religion, Mycenaean trade)
4. **Methodological rigor** (the "method of doublets," functional analysis) that elevates speculation to scholarship

As a Semitist writing about Greek material—rather than a Hellenist dabbling in Semitic—Astour brings the deep knowledge of Ugaritic, Akkadian, and Phoenician that earlier comparativists lacked.

## Biography

Born in Russia, Astour studied at the Sorbonne in the 1930s under Charles Virolleaud (first publisher of Ugaritic texts) and Pierre Roussel. His education was interrupted by seventeen years in Soviet political prisons and labor camps (1939–1956). Even in detention, he continued research by borrowing books from the Lenin Library in Moscow.

After emigrating to the United States in 1956, he joined Cyrus H. Gordon's Department of Mediterranean Studies at Brandeis, where he completed *Hellenosemitica* (1965). Gordon's foreword to that work describes Astour as "one of the few scholars with the knowledge, ability and vision to execute a comprehensive analysis of early HellenoSemitic relations."

> "Greek myths placed in the beginning of the Heroic Age in Greece such characters as the Phoenician Cadmos in Thebes, the Phoenician Europa in Crete, the Egyptian Danaos in Argos... Was there any historical reality behind these reports?" (Astour 1965: xiii)

## Core Methodology

### The Method of Doublets

Borrowed from Victor Bérard, refined by Astour. When a Mediterranean locality has two names—one Greek, one non-Greek—and the Greek is an exact translation of the non-Greek, this proves the non-Greek origin.

**Example**: The island Anaphe was also called *Membliaros*. Astour analyzes this as W-S *mêm-bli-'âr*, "waters without light"—matching the cosmogonic darkness described in Apollonius Rhodius's *Argonautica* IV.1694-98 when the Argonauts approach that very island.

### Functional Parallelism

Names alone may be coincidental. But when:
- A Greek name resembles a Semitic name, AND
- The mythological function of both figures matches, AND
- Other names in the same mythological complex also show Semitic parallels

—then coincidence is "more and more eliminated" and probability "grows in geometric proportion."

**Example**: Cadmos = W-S *qadm* ("East/Dawn"). His sister Europa = W-S *'arôb šamši* ("Sunset"). At Ugarit, *Šḥr* (Dawn) and *Šlm* (Dusk) are divine siblings. Functional parallel confirmed.

### The Method of Vestiges

Details in a myth that are "redundant or inexplicable in its present form but are quite normal and understandable in a different, older version." These vestiges reveal the Semitic prototype beneath the Greek surface.

**Example**: Euphemus in the Argonautica can run across the sea without wetting his feet—a detail that plays no role in the plot but matches "the Spirit of God moving over the waters" in Genesis and Phoenician cosmogony.

## Key Contributions by Work

### Hellenosemitica (1965)

**Full Title**: *Hellenosemitica: An Ethnic and Cultural Study in West Semitic Impact on Mycenaean Greece*

**Publisher**: E. J. Brill, Leiden (with financial assistance from Brandeis University)

**Dedication**: To Charles Virolleaud, "en hommage de respect et de profonde gratitude"

**Core Thesis**: West Semitic influence was "one, though important, factor in the formation of Mycenaean civilization." The evidence includes:

- **Chapter I**: The Danaans (*Danaoi*) = the Danunians (*Dnnym*) of Cilicia, attested in Egyptian and Phoenician sources
- **Chapter II**: Cadmos and the entire Theban cycle carry Semitic names, plots, and cult elements (Semele, Dionysos, Actaeon = Aqht)
- **Chapter III**: Greek healer-heroes (Bellerophon, Asclepios, Jason) derive from Ugaritic healing deity traditions (*Rpu-Bʿl*, Rephaim)
- **Chapter IV**: Archaeological and epigraphic evidence (Linear A as Semitic, Mycenaean tablets, circumcision among Achaeans)

### Greek Names in the Semitic World (JNES 1964)

**Key methodological statement**: Explains doublets, functional parallels, and vestiges. Provides worked examples: Membliaros, Poikiles, Cadmos/Europa, Semele/Aqht.

### Aegean Place-Names in an Egyptian Inscription (AJA 1966)

**Source analyzed**: Amenhotep III's statue base "C" with 9 Aegean place-names. Astour identifies: Knossos, Amnisos, Lyktos, Kydonia (Crete); plus Messenia, Nauplion, Kythera, Tegea, and potentially others.

### Some New Divine Names from Ugarit (JAOS 1966)

**Tablets analyzed**: RS 24.xxx series. Identifies new deities including Mare-goddess (parallel to Phigalian Demeter), Ngh w Srr = Lucifer/Morning Star, and earliest attestation of Kěmôš (Chemosh).

## Scholarly Lineage

### Builds On
- **Charles Virolleaud**: Ugaritic decipherment, first to suggest Semele = *Ṣml*
- **Victor Bérard**: Method of doublets, rehabilitated Phoenician hypothesis
- **Cyrus H. Gordon**: Linear A as Semitic, general Aegean-Semitic connections
- **T. B. L. Webster** & **Gabriel Germain**: Near Eastern elements in Homer

### Disputes
- **Julius Beloch**: Who in 1894 "asserted, with unusual sharpness but with very weak arguments, that all reports on Phoenicians in Greece were absolutely baseless"
- **Pauly-Wissowa school**: Who declared even Cadmos and Adonis "non-Semitic"
- **Thracianist school** (Rohde, Nilsson, Harrison): Who attributed Dionysiac cult to Thrace rather than Semitic East

### Influences
- Modern comparative mythologists working on Greek-Near Eastern connections
- Scholars of Ugaritic religion and its Mediterranean diffusion
- Researchers on Bronze Age Mediterranean trade networks
