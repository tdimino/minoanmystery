## Overview

This concluding chapter marshals the archaeological, epigraphic, and documentary evidence for West Semitic penetration into the Aegean during the Bronze Age. Astour systematically dismantles Beloch's 1894 argument that archaeology contradicts Phoenician presence in Greece, presenting material proofs: Schaeffer's "Torque-Bearers" who brought bronze metallurgy from Syria to Europe via the Aegean, Mari texts mentioning Kaptara (Crete), Syrian architectural influence on Minoan palaces (Woolley), Cyrus Gordon's decipherment of Linear A as West Semitic and Eteocretan inscriptions as "Phoenician," documentary evidence of massive Ugaritic ship-building capacity, the Cape Gelidonya shipwreck, and the remarkable testimony of circumcision among the Achaeans in Merneptah's inscription. The chapter concludes that Mycenaean civilization was "essentially a peripheral culture of the Ancient East, its westernmost extension."

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the physical and documentary proof for the cultural transmission argued in Chapters I–III, establishing that Semitic presence in the Aegean was not merely mythological but archaeologically and epigraphically attested.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Beloch's Anti-Phoenician Thesis Refuted (pp. 323–326)

Astour begins by confronting Julius Beloch's influential 1894 article *Die Phoeniker am aegaeischen Meer*, which "had a baneful influence out of proportion to its modest size."

**Beloch's claims**:
- Phoenicians never visited the Aegean before the VIIIth century
- Their ships were too small for such voyages
- Semitic words could only have entered Greek via land-route through Asia Minor
- "The last word belongs here, as everywhere in prehistoric questions, to the monuments"

**Astour's response**: "Now, in our own time, Beloch's argumentation makes an almost ridiculous impression. What did he know about ancient navigation and the minimum size of a ship able to sustain a voyage from Syria to Crete?"

### 2. Schaeffer's Torque-Bearers: Syrian Bronze Metallurgy to Europe (pp. 326–330)

Claude F.-A. Schaeffer discovered at Ras Shamra bronze weapons and ornaments characteristic of Central European Early Bronze, which he traced to a specific population group:

**The "Torque-Bearer" assemblage** (Middle Ugarit I, 2100–1900):
- Triangular daggers with hilts finished in crescents
- Spears with sockets
- Flat axes with blades pierced by "windows"
- Massive bronze neck rings (*torques*)
- Toggle-pins and wire spirals

**Distribution**: Found identically at Ugarit, Byblos, Qaṭna, Megiddo, Sidon, Gezer—and in Central Europe (Hungary, Bohemia) from about 1800–1700.

**The sea-route**: "According to the investigations, the Torque-Bearers did not take the land route—the 'torque' is lacking on this route [i.e., in West Anatolia and the Balkans]. This compels us to admit that the Torque-Bearers of Syria, the prospectors and artisans of metal, took the sea." (Schaeffer)

> "The Torque-Bearers were originally no Semites, but they rapidly became Semitized after their establishment in Syria. And, certainly, without the commercial genius of the Proto-Phoenicians, without their experience of the seas, they would not have been able to traverse the Mediterranean." (Schaeffer, quoted p. 328)

### 3. Documentary Evidence: Mari, Cythera, Alalah (pp. 329–333)

**Mari texts** (18th century): Mention **Kap-ta-ra** (Kaphtor/Crete), confirming mutual relations between Crete and Mesopotamia via North Syrian coastal cities.

**Akkadian votive inscription from Cythera** (18th century): Corroborates archaeological data of Syro-Aegean contact.

**Woolley on Alalah**: After excavating the palace of King Yarim-Lim (Level VII), Woolley traced "unmistakable connections with Crete":
- Construction methods identical to Knossos
- Frescoes "identical in colouring, technique, and style"

> "There can be no doubt but that Crete owes the best of its architecture, and its frescoes, to the Asiatic mainland. And we can say more than this... These professional techniques require direct contacts, and we are bound to believe that trained experts, members of the Architects' and Painters' Guilds, were invited to travel overseas from Asia." (Woolley, quoted p. 333)

### 4. Linear A as West Semitic (pp. 344–349)

Astour summarizes Cyrus H. Gordon's decipherment findings:

**Linguistic milieu of Linear A**: "Exactly the same as in Ugarit, where a mixed West-Semitic (W-S) and Hurrian Semitized population lived in a state of perfect symbiosis."

**Onomastic evidence**: "While names of Syrian origin in the Mycenaean (Linear B) texts form only a minority in a predominantly Greek milieu, the Minoan (Linear A) onomastica known so far is practically all Syrian."

**Implication**: "This betrays the existence of a solid and compact Semitic population in the eastern and central parts of Crete. It was by far more important than mere commercial foreign enclaves in harbor cities."

### 5. Eteocretan Inscriptions as "Phoenician" (pp. 349–352)

Gordon's 1962 discovery that Eteocretan ("true Cretan") inscriptions—written in Greek characters but in a non-Greek language—are West Semitic:

**Examples Gordon deciphered**:
- *me y mar krk o kl es y es* = *mē hū' mar krak 'ô kol 'îš we-'îš* "whosoever (whether) son of the city or any man at all"
- *mosel os phraiso* = *môšel 'oz Prays-* "the mighty ruler of Praisos"

**Historical significance**: The Eteocretans did not use the Phoenician alphabet, proving "they were not recent migrants from Phoenicia, but direct descendants of the W-S Minoans from mid-second millennium, who settled in Crete before the invention of the Phoenician alphabet."

> "When Beloch tendentiously tried to ridicule Phoenician presence in any spot of Greece, he ironically asked: if there were Phoenicians in Crete, why are they not listed among the five peoples of the island?... Now C. H. Gordon demonstrated that precisely one of those five peoples, the Eteocretans, were Phoenicians!" (p. 352)

### 6. Ugaritic Ship-Building and Maritime Capacity (pp. 352–357)

**RS 20.212** (late 12th century): Hittite court requests one Ugaritic ship to transport 2,000 *kor* (≈6,000 hectoliters = 450 metric tons) of grain in one or two trips.

> "Nougayrol, in his recently published report, tries to evaluate the capacity of that ship... 'The author of the letter admitted thus that the king of Ugarit disposed, or could dispose, of ships capable of carrying about 500 tons, or perhaps even more.' A vessel of 500 tons—even half as big—certainly could even cross the Atlantic, not only the short sea-distances on the route: Ugarit-Cyprus-Southwest Asia Minor-Crete." (p. 354)

**RS 16.238**: Documents a Ugaritic merchant returning with his ship from **Kapturi** (Crete).

**RS 20.238**: Reveals that the Ugaritic fleet was stationed "in the Lycian country" defending against the Sea Peoples—"at the very entrance into the Aegean."

### 7. Cape Gelidonya Shipwreck (pp. 357–358)

The University of Pennsylvania underwater archaeology expedition found an ancient wreck off Cape Gelidonya in Lycia (c. 1200):

- Ship heavily loaded with Cypriot copper ingots (stamped with Cypro-Minoan signs)
- Scarabs, oil-lamp, and skipper's seal are Syrian
- Wood analysis shows "the ship was probably made with Syrian wood"
- A smith traveled on board as "an ambulant metallurgic workshop"

> "We are in presence of a Syrian vessel which not only carried copper to the Aegean, but also served as an ambulant metallurgic workshop to supply with tools the harbors it visited." (p. 358)

### 8. No Mycenaean Settlement at Ugarit (pp. 359–365)

Astour refutes the theory (Dussaud, Webster) that Greeks settled at Ugarit and transmitted Eastern culture back to Greece:

**Documentary evidence against Mycenaean presence**:
- "Among the ethnic names listed in Ugaritic administrative texts, we find Assyrians, Egyptians, Subaraeans, Mittanites, Hittites, Arzawians, Hurrians, Amorites, Canaanites, Nuhaššeans, Alašiots, and natives of several Phoenician and Palestinian cities"
- "No Achaeans, Aeolians, Ionians, Cretans, Caphtorians, Cnossians, Rhodians or any other ethnic or geographical names of the Greco-Aegean world can be found in Ugaritic texts"

**Conclusion**: "These indications are quite precise. They prove that no Mycenaean settlement existed at Ugarit in the XIVth and XIIIth centuries."

### 9. Circumcision Among the Achaeans (pp. 365–369)

Merneptah's inscription (c. 1225) describes carnal trophies from the Sea Peoples:
- From Libyans: phalli cut off (they had *qrn't* "foreskin")
- From Sardana, Šak(a)ruša, Turuša, and **'Aqiyawaša**: hands cut off, "who had no *qrn't*"

**'Aqiyawaša** = Ahhiyawā = Achaeans—they were circumcised.

> "Only the settlement in Greece of an important group of population whose religious and ritual principles would be adopted by large masses of the people, could have introduced the general spread of circumcision among the Achaeans... Circumcision among the Achaeans, attested by the eye-witness Merneptah, shows most convincingly how strongly W-S ritual customs became rooted among them." (p. 368)

### 10. Concluding Thesis: Greece as Peripheral Eastern Culture (pp. 369–374)

> "Not only was Phoenician spoken in several parts of Mycenaean Greece, but the entire Mycenaean civilization was essentially a peripheral culture of the Ancient East, its westernmost extension." (p. 370)

**Geopolitical parallel**: "Greece and Syria-Palestine were very similar in their geographical and natural conditions. Both were broken, geographically dismembered territories without a central organizing axis."

**The two swings of the Mediterranean pendulum**:
> "Long before Hellenism imposed itself over the ancient civilizations of the East, Semitism had exercised no less an impact upon the young civilization of Greece. Hellenism became the epilogue of the Oriental civilizations, but Semitism was the prologue of Greek civilization." (p. 374)

## Notable Passages

> "The famous archaeologist and historian of civilization V. Gordon Childe wrote about the transition from Neolithic to Bronze in Crete: 'The neolithic phase was ended by a quickening impulse from the Nile, which permeated the rude island culture and transformed it... At the same time even more explicitly Asiatic traits can be detected among the innovations.'" (p. 325)

> "In 1939, some scholars assumed that the Ugaritic king Nqmd was the Greek Nikomédés... But it was soon clarified that Nqmd (Niqmadu) was a pure W-S name signifying 'Hadd is the avenger.'" (p. 361)

> "Kšr is a good W-S name: 'the appropriate, the useful, the one who adjusts things'—a most fitting name for the artisan and artist of the divine family. If Kaphtor was assigned to him as his domain, this was because Crete, before it was conquered by the Greeks, was considered a part of the Canaanite world." (p. 364)

> "It would be one-sided to consider the Greek polis, evolved from the conditions of the Homeric age, as something exclusively Greek, and to oppose it to the Mycenaean order, which is characterized as Asiatic... Canaanite cities, as early as the Amarna Age, were far from being despotic bureaucratic monarchies." (p. 373)
