## Overview

This article analyzes newly discovered Ugaritic texts from the 24th excavation campaign at Ras Shamra (1961), focusing on divine names appearing for the first time in Ugaritic literature. Astour identifies key deities including: the Mare-goddess *Phlt* (parallel to Phigalian "Black Demeter"); *Ttt/Kmt* (earliest attestation of Chemosh); *Ngh w Srr* (prototype of Isaiah's Lucifer/Morning Star); *Dqt* (goat-goddess paralleling Cretan Dikte); *Trt* ("wine" deity = possible Bacchus prototype); and *Itm* (guilt-offering personified = earliest form of Phoenician *Ešmûn*). The article demonstrates extensive Greco-Semitic religious parallels and contributes to understanding the "Aegean Oriental religious *koinē*."

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This article provides direct textual evidence from Ugarit for the Semitic origins of Greek divine figures, including the prototype of Lucifer, the etymology of Bacchic *thyrsoi*, and the mare-goddess parallel to Black Demeter—all supporting the broader Hellenosemitic thesis.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Mare-Goddess Phlt and Black Demeter (RS 24.244)

**Text introduction**: "*um. phl. phlt. bt. 'n. bt. abn. bt šmm w thm... qrit. l špš. umh*" = "the mother of Phl, Phlt, daughter of the Spring, daughter of the Stone, daughter of the Sky and of the Ocean, calls to Špš her mother"

**Phigalian parallel**: Pausanias (VIII:42:1-13) describes an archaic wooden image (xoanon) of "Dēmētēr Melaina" (Black Demeter) or "Dēō Hippolechos" (Deo who bore a horse) in southwestern Arcadia:
- "The Phigalian xoanon had the body of a woman with the head and mane of a horse"
- "There grew out of her head images of serpents and other beasts"
- Located near a spring of cold water (cf. *bt 'n* "daughter of the Spring")
- Sitting on a rock (cf. *bt abn* "daughter of the Stone")
- Having dolphin and dove, symbols of sea and sky (cf. *bt šmm w thm* "daughter of the Sky and Ocean")

> "RS 24.244, unearthed thirty years after V. Bérard's death, offers an exact parallel to all details given by Pausanias. We may safely ascribe the introduction of this iconographic entity into southwestern Arcadia to the Mycenaean Age."

### 2. Ttt/Kmt = Chemosh (RS 24.244, RS 24.251, RS 24.271)

**The binomial**: *Tttw Kmt* (RS 24.244:36) = *'ttw Kmt* (RS 24.271:5)

**Kmt identification**: "The second component of the binomial... is identical with the later chief god of the Moabites, Heb. *Kěmôš*, LXX *Chamôs*, Moabite inscriptional *Kmš*, Assyrian *Ka-a-mu-su*."

**Ttt etymology**: "*Ttt* (Heb. *tīt*, Akk. *tītu*) signifies 'clay' which, together with 'dust' and 'darkness,' was one of the attributes of the Babylonian Nether World."

**Alternate name 'tt**: Virolleaud explained as Heb. *'āyiṭ* "bird of prey" (eagle or vulture)—"an image from the Babylonian 'Land without return,' the residents of which are described as winged and feathered bird-like creatures."

**Tityos connection**: "The doublet *Ttt='tt* leads us to a Greek mythological character, Tityos, son of Earth, who in the Nekyia... is depicted as being punished in the Hades by having his liver eternally torn by two vultures."

### 3. Earth and Heaven as Divine Entity (RS 24.643)

**First attestation**: "*ars w šmm*" (RS 24.643:obv. 5)—"This is the first time that Earth and Heaven appear in a Ugaritic text as a divine entity."

**Sequence significance**: "The sequence—Earth standing before Heaven—is the opposite of the Sumerian and Akkadian usage (*an.ki*, *šamû w erṣetu*)... but is the same as in the creation story of J (Gen. 2:4b) which has preserved the Canaanite pattern."

**Philo parallel**: "According to Philo of Byblos, *Ilos* with his brothers and sisters were born of a union of *Uranos* and *Gē*."

### 4. Four Hypostases of El (RS 24.643)

The restored list shows four forms of El matching Philo of Byblos:

| Ugaritic | Akkadian | Philo's Phoenician |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| *Il Spn* | — | Atlas (mountain god) |
| *Ilib* | *Il-a-bi* | Baitylos (*bēt-'ēl*, sacred stone) |
| *Il* | *Ilum* | Ilos/Élos (= Kronos) |
| *Dgn* | *Dagan* | Dagōn (= Zeus Arotrios) |

### 5. Seven Hypostases of Baal/Adad (RS 24.643)

"Seven hypostases of the next highest ranking god: *Adad bursa Hazi*, *Adad 1*, *Adad 2*, and so on up to *Adad 6* in the Akkadian version; [*B'l Spn*], then *B'l-m* repeated six times, in the Ugaritic."

**Parallel**: "An Assyrian text from Assur also lists seven Adads"—differentiated by their renowned shrines.

### 6. Ngh w Srr = Lucifer/Morning Star (RS 24.271:12)

**Etymology**:
- *NGH* "to shine" (Ugaritic, Syriac, Ethiopic; Hebrew *nôgah* = "brightness," Mishnaic = Venus)
- *SRR* "to rebel" (Hebrew, Akkadian D-form *sarāru*)

**Isaiah parallel**: "We have here the earliest occurrence of the rebellious hero of the magnificent mythological poem, Isaiah 14:12-15: *Hēlel ben-Šahar*, 'Morning Star... son of Dawn,' who tried 'to ascend to heaven,' to 'sit on the Mount of Assembly in the far North' and to make himself 'like the Most High (*'Elyôn*),' but was brought down to Sheol."

> "One feels a certain emotion in discovering its prototype in a Ugaritic tablet written some six or eight hundred years before the dirge in Isaiah 14 and some three thousand years before Milton's *Paradise Lost*."

### 7. Sdq Mšr = Righteousness and Justice (RS 24.271:14)

**Identification**: "Personifications of 'righteousness' and 'justice,' Babylonian *Kettu* and *Mēsaru* (personified as sons of *Šamaš*, the god of justice), Philo's sixth pair of primeval brothers, *Misôr* and *Sydyk*."

**First attestation**: "The nouns *sdq* and *mšr* have been known in Ugaritic literary texts... but this is the first time that they are found as a divine pair."

### 8. Itm = Ešmûn Prototype (RS 24.643)

**The divine pair**: *Šgr w Itm* (RS 24.643:rev. 9)

**Itm etymology**: "*Itm* is the same word as the Ugaritic noun *iṭm* = Arab. *'iṭm* = Heb. *'āšām*, i.e., 'guilt,' 'transgression,' and 'guilt offering.'"

**Ešmûn connection** (quoting Astour's 1951/52 work):
> "Disease was considered the result of some fault or guilt (*'āšām*) that had first to be identified and then atoned... Therefore the healer-god, too, received the name *'Āšām*... Amos 8:14 mentions this deity as *'Āšēmāt* of Samaria; II Kings 17:30 knows him, in the Aramaic form *'Ašima'*, as a god of the men of Hamath. The Phoenician healer-god *'Ešmûn* bears the same name with the suffix *-ûn*."

**Confirmation**: "We have here the earliest recorded mention of the god that later, in the first millennium B.C., was worshipped all over the West Semitic world under names derived from the root *'TM*."

### 9. Dqt = Goat-Goddess / Cretan Dikte (RS 24.246:8)

**Etymology**: "*Dqt*, literally 'a female head of small cattle for sacrifices'... pronounced... *daqqatu* or *diqqatu*."

**Cretan parallel**: "Now *Di-ka-tu* was the Linear A name of Cretan Mt. *Dikte* (*Di-ka-ta* in Linear B) which Hesiod (Theog. 481) called *Aigaion oros*, 'Goat's Mountain.'"

**Cross-reference**: "Among the nine Cretan and Peloponnesian toponyms in a recently published list of Amenophis III, the name *Di-qa-* figures with the determinative 'high.' I recognized in it the Semitic spelling *Dqt*."

### 10. Trt = Wine-God / Bacchus Prototype (RS 24.246:9)

**Etymology**: "*Trt*, literally 'grape-juice' (synonym of 'wine'), Heb. *tirōš*, Phoen. (Karatepe) *trš*, Ugar. *trt*."

**Albright's hypothesis confirmed**: "'This hitherto unknown divinity may perhaps have been a kind of Bacchus from whose name the Israelites got their poetic word *tirōš* for "wine."' This hypothesis has now been completely confirmed by the occurrence of the deity *Trt* in two Ugaritic lists of gods."

**Thyrsoi connection**: "The proposed derivation of the term *thyrsoi*, the sacral wands carried at the festivals of Dionysos, from this West Semitic word for 'wine,' has also been strengthened by the disclosure that *trt* had a religious connotation in the West Semitic world."

### 11. Išhara and Serpent Cult (RS 24.60)

**The epithet**: "*Ušhr hlmt*"—the healer-goddess Išhara with epithet *hlmt* = Akkadian *hulmittu*, "a kind of snake."

**Significance**: "The connection of fertility- and healer-gods with snakes is extremely old and widespread... the serpent or dragon was indeed an emblem of *Išhara*... but this is so far the only piece of evidence on the existence of serpent-cult in Ugarit."
