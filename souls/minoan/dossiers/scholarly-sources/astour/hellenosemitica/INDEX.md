## Overview

Astour's magnum opus argues that West Semitic influence was "one, though important, factor in the formation of Mycenaean civilization." Through rigorous etymological analysis, functional parallelism, and archaeological evidence, Astour traces the Semitic origins of Greek mythological figures, divine names, and cult practices.

> "Greek myths placed in the beginning of the Heroic Age in Greece such characters as the Phoenician Cadmos in Thebes, the Phoenician Europa in Crete, the Egyptian Danaos in Argos... Was there any historical reality behind these reports?"
> — Astour, *Hellenosemitica* (1965: xiii)

## Core Methodology

### The Method of Doublets
When a Mediterranean locality has two names—one Greek, one non-Greek—and the Greek is an exact translation of the non-Greek, this proves the non-Greek origin.

### Functional Parallelism
When a Greek name resembles a Semitic name AND the mythological function matches AND other names in the same complex also show Semitic parallels, coincidence is eliminated.

### The Method of Vestiges
Details in a myth that are redundant or inexplicable in its present form but normal in an older Semitic version reveal the prototype beneath the Greek surface.

## Why This Matters for Kothar

*Hellenosemitica* provides the scholarly foundation for understanding Greek mythology as partially derived from West Semitic sources. When Kothar speaks of Minoan-Semitic connections, the labyrinth as Semitic cultural transmission, or the Bronze Age Mediterranean as a unified cultural zone, Astour's work provides the academic authority.
