## Overview

This chapter is the heart of *Hellenosemitica*—Astour's most sustained demonstration that the Theban mythological cycle (Cadmos, Europa, Semele, Dionysos, Actaeon, Pentheus) derives from West Semitic religious traditions. Astour begins not with Cadmos himself but with the obscure Phoenician settler Membliaros on the island of Thera, showing that even minor figures in Herodotus preserve authentic Semitic cosmogonic traditions. He then traces Europa (= W-S *ʿarôb*, "sunset") and Cadmos (= W-S *qadm*, "east/dawn") as the Evening and Morning Stars—siblings who can never meet. The chapter culminates in detailed analyses of Semele (= Ugaritic *Ṣml*, "Eagle-Mother"), Actaeon (= Ugaritic *Aqht*), and the Semitic elements pervading the cult of Dionysos.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the core evidence that Greek mythology's most famous Phoenician—Cadmos—actually was Phoenician, with name, myths, and cult elements traceable to Ugarit and broader West Semitic religion.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Membliaros and Cosmogonic Memory (pp. 113–127)

Herodotus (IV.147) reports that Phoenicians under Membliaros son of Poikiles settled on Thera. Astour demonstrates this is not invention but authentic memory of West Semitic cosmogonic ritual:

- **Membliaros** = W-S *mêm-bli-ʾâr*, "waters without light"
- **Poikiles** = W-S *pî-kôl*, "womb of all" (the primordial chaos)

The cosmogonic darkness described in Apollonius Rhodius's *Argonautica* IV.1694-98—"black chaos descended from heaven"—occurs precisely at the island Anaphe-Membliaros, proving the Semitic etymology correct.

> "The fragment speaks for itself; it operates with such notions, sacralized by liturgic tradition, as 'black chaos' and 'darkness rising from the nethermost depths,' which reminds one of 'the dark air' and 'the obscure, Erebos-like chaos' of Philo, and 'darkness upon the face of the Deep' of Gen. I: 2." (p. 120)

### 2. Europa as the Evening Star (pp. 128–147)

Hesychius defines *Eurōpē* as "land of sunset, or dark one" (*chōra tēs dyseōs, ē skoteinē*). This semantics cannot derive from Greek but only from Semitic *ʿrb* ("to set," of the sun; "to be dark").

Astour identifies Europa's Semitic prototype in Ugaritic texts:
- *UM 9:9* lists offerings for *ʿrb špš*, "the personified sunset"
- An Akkadian hymn in Ugaritic script (UM 104) hymns "Night, the veiled bride, who enters into the sunset"

The constant epithet of this Night-goddess—*kuttumtum*, "veiled"—appears on Greek coins of Europa and in the Cretan name **Tektamos** (= W-S *tiktam*, "she is veiled").

> "The myth of Europa: the goddess of night, the veiled bride, who goes away into the sunset, as Europa (= Sunset/Evening) was carried away far westward, to Crete, and there became the mate of Zeus." (p. 137)

### 2a. Phoenix and the Phoenicians (pp. 139–147)

Astour demonstrates that wherever the eponym Phoenix appears in Greek myth, Semitic traces are present:

| Greek Name | Semitic Etymology | Meaning | Evidence |
|------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| **Phoenix** | *Pûnî* | "Of the madder-dye" | Num. 26:23; *puwwā* = *Rubia tinctorum L.* |
| **Itanos** (son of Phoenix) | *'êtân* | "Strong, perennial" | *nahal 'êtân* (Amos 5:24) |
| **Karnos** (son of Phoenix) | *qarn* | "Horn" | Coins spell *Qrn*; Latin *Cornu Phenices* |
| **Kythera** (son of Phoenix) | *keter, kōteret* | "Crown, tiara" | Method of doublets with *Skandeia* |

**Archaeological evidence**: A cuneiform dedication of Naram-Sin, king of Ešnunna (18th century BCE), was found on Cythera—proving Mesopotamian connections through Semitic maritime routes.

> "Wherever the eponym or toponym Phoenix is found, evident traces of Semitism are present." (p. 143)

### 2b. Scholars' Reluctance and the Case for Semitism (pp. 147–152)

Astour addresses the systematic effort to deny Cadmos's Phoenician origin:

**Ed. Meyer's objection**: Thebes' "mid-continent" location contradicts Phoenician coastal settlement patterns.

**Astour's rebuttal**: Thebes lies only 12 miles from the Gulf of Corinth and 15 miles from the Euripos. Compare: Alalah was 25+ miles from the sea; Adana and Karatepe similarly inland—yet their kings had ships and engaged in sea-battles (depicted in Azitawadd's palace reliefs).

> "The topography of Thebes corresponds exactly to that of the capitals of the North Canaanite maritime states which, in the IId millennium, linked the Orient with the Aegean." (p. 151)

### 3. Cadmos as the Morning Star (pp. 147–159)

**Cadmos** = W-S *qadm*, "east/front/dawn." Three Greek forms (*Kadmos*, *Kadmōn*, *Kadmaíōn*) reflect W-S forms (*Qdm*, *Qdmn*, *Qdmyn*).

Astour's key insight: Cadmos and Europa are the two aspects of Venus—Morning Star (male) and Evening Star (female)—who can never meet:

> "If Europa is the west, the Evening Star, then Cadmos, as shown by his name, is the east, the Morning Star... The Evening Star goes away to the west, disappears beyond the sea; the Morning Star, her brother, rushes to her search, but the two can never meet." (p. 153)

A god *Qa-a-dm-u* is attested in Babylonia. In the Ugaritic poem UM 75:I.7-8, *qdm* ("East") parallels *šhr* ("Dawn"), establishing that *Qdm* was another name for the dawn-god *Šahar*.

Cadmos's serpent-transformation connects him to the Sumerian *Ningišzida*—a chthonic serpent-god, personification of sunrise, dragon-victor, and city-founder.

**The Ningišzida Parallels:**

| Shared Motif | Cadmos | Ningišzida |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| **Serpent symbolism** | Transformed into entwined serpents | Serpent-god, entwined serpent emblem |
| **Dragon-victor** | Kills the dragon at Thebes | Conquers dragons |
| **Sunrise personification** | *Qadm* = "East/Dawn" | "Sun which rose from the fruitful earth" |
| **City-founder** | Founds Thebes | Establishes city foundations |

> "The goddess Nanše revealed in his dream: 'The sun which rose from the fruitful earth is thy god Ningizzida who, like the sun, rises for thee out of the fruitful earth.'" (p. 157, quoting Gudea)

**The Cabiri Connection:**

The Cabiri (*Kabeiroi*) = W-S *kabbîr* "great, mighty." Their worship centers (Thebes, Samothrace) connect to Cadmos:
- Original number: seven (matching Ugaritic poem UM 52 with *Šhr*, *Šlm*, and five anonymous gods)
- The only known Cabiri name: **Kadmilos** = W-S *Qadm-ʾēl* "Qadm the god" (cf. Hebrew *Qadmîʾēl* Ezra 3:9)

### 4. The Cadmeian Cycle: Semele, Actaeon, Dionysos (pp. 163–223)

**Semele** (= Ugaritic *Ṣml*, "Eagle-Mother"):
In the Ugaritic poem of Aqht, the goddess *Ṣml* is the "Mother of the Eagles" who swallowed the remains of the slain hero Aqht. In Greek myth, Semele swallows Dionysos's heart and becomes pregnant with his new incarnation.

> "Ṣml thus corresponds to Semele both by her name and by her function in the myth." (from Greek Names article, cf. p. 170)

**Actaeon** (= Ugaritic *Aqht*):
The proud young hunter torn apart by his hounds directly parallels Aqht, the proud young hunter slain for refusing to cede his bow to the goddess Anath. The name derives from extended forms *Aqhtn* or *Aqhtyn*.

**Dionysos** and his epithets:
- *Bakchos* = W-S *bākuy*, from root *bākâ*, "to weep" (cf. Hesychius: *bakchon* is Phoenician for "mourning")
- *Bassareus* / *Bassarids* = W-S *bāṣar*, "to cut, to tear to pieces"

The myth of Zagreus-Dionysos (dismembered and eaten by Titans) has close parallels in Ugaritic texts describing the fate of Aqht.

## Notable Passages

> "With all the recognized weaknesses of Herodotus, he still knew more about the Phoenicians than Beloch and his followers." (p. 113, quoting W.F. Albright)

> "We, thus, found what was to be proved—'dark waters' without any glimpse of light (the very *mêm-bli-ʾâr* we had discovered in Membliaros), and located, of all places, exactly at Membliaros-Anaphe." (p. 120)

> "Cadmos and Europa are the two aspects of the planet Venus, the Morning and the Evening Stars, which were first believed to be two distinct luminaries... According to the Babylonian conception, the planet Venus as the Morning Star was male, as the Evening Star female." (p. 153)

> "Such is the mythological essence of Cadmos. His name and almost all of his adventures and attributes are Oriental and originated in W-S myths of the god of sunrise, strongly influenced by the image of the Sumerian Ningišzida, the serpent-god of fertility, sunrise, and the building of cities." (p. 157)

> "Almost everything in this myth [of Actaeon] goes back to the W-S myth which is evidenced in detail and with great art in the Ugaritic poem of Aqht." (p. 164)

> "The seven-year rhythm, the change of sex, and especially the symbol of the entwined serpents point to the East in an epoch which was quite remote in the scale of Greek history." (p. 163, on Teiresias)
