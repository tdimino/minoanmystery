## Overview

This chapter is the heart of *Hellenosemitica*—Astour's most sustained demonstration that the Theban mythological cycle (Cadmos, Europa, Semele, Dionysos, Actaeon, Pentheus) derives from West Semitic religious traditions. Astour begins not with Cadmos himself but with the obscure Phoenician settler Membliaros on the island of Thera, showing that even minor figures in Herodotus preserve authentic Semitic cosmogonic traditions. He then traces Europa (= W-S *ʿarôb*, "sunset") and Cadmos (= W-S *qadm*, "east/dawn") as the Evening and Morning Stars—siblings who can never meet. The chapter culminates in detailed analyses of Semele (= Ugaritic *Ṣml*, "Eagle-Mother"), Actaeon (= Ugaritic *Aqht*), and the Semitic elements pervading the cult of Dionysos.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the core evidence that Greek mythology's most famous Phoenician—Cadmos—actually was Phoenician, with name, myths, and cult elements traceable to Ugarit and broader West Semitic religion.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Membliaros and Cosmogonic Memory (pp. 113–127)

Herodotus (IV.147) reports that Phoenicians under Membliaros son of Poikiles settled on Thera. Astour demonstrates this is not invention but authentic memory of West Semitic cosmogonic ritual:

- **Membliaros** = W-S *mêm-bli-ʾâr*, "waters without light"
- **Poikiles** = W-S *pî-kôl*, "womb of all" (the primordial chaos)

The cosmogonic darkness described in Apollonius Rhodius's *Argonautica* IV.1694-98—"black chaos descended from heaven"—occurs precisely at the island Anaphe-Membliaros, proving the Semitic etymology correct.

> "The fragment speaks for itself; it operates with such notions, sacralized by liturgic tradition, as 'black chaos' and 'darkness rising from the nethermost depths,' which reminds one of 'the dark air' and 'the obscure, Erebos-like chaos' of Philo, and 'darkness upon the face of the Deep' of Gen. I: 2." (p. 120)

### 2. Europa as the Evening Star (pp. 128–147)

Hesychius defines *Eurōpē* as "land of sunset, or dark one" (*chōra tēs dyseōs, ē skoteinē*). This semantics cannot derive from Greek but only from Semitic *ʿrb* ("to set," of the sun; "to be dark").

Astour identifies Europa's Semitic prototype in Ugaritic texts:
- *UM 9:9* lists offerings for *ʿrb špš*, "the personified sunset"
- An Akkadian hymn in Ugaritic script (UM 104) hymns "Night, the veiled bride, who enters into the sunset"

The constant epithet of this Night-goddess—*kuttumtum*, "veiled"—appears on Greek coins of Europa and in the Cretan name **Tektamos** (= W-S *tiktam*, "she is veiled").

> "The myth of Europa: the goddess of night, the veiled bride, who goes away into the sunset, as Europa (= Sunset/Evening) was carried away far westward, to Crete, and there became the mate of Zeus." (p. 137)

### 3. Cadmos as the Morning Star (pp. 147–159)

**Cadmos** = W-S *qadm*, "east/front/dawn." Three Greek forms (*Kadmos*, *Kadmōn*, *Kadmaíōn*) reflect W-S forms (*Qdm*, *Qdmn*, *Qdmyn*).

Astour's key insight: Cadmos and Europa are the two aspects of Venus—Morning Star (male) and Evening Star (female)—who can never meet:

> "If Europa is the west, the Evening Star, then Cadmos, as shown by his name, is the east, the Morning Star... The Evening Star goes away to the west, disappears beyond the sea; the Morning Star, her brother, rushes to her search, but the two can never meet." (p. 153)

A god *Qa-a-dm-u* is attested in Babylonia. In the Ugaritic poem UM 75:I.7-8, *qdm* ("East") parallels *šhr* ("Dawn"), establishing that *Qdm* was another name for the dawn-god *Šahar*.

Cadmos's serpent-transformation connects him to the Sumerian *Ningišzida*—a chthonic serpent-god, personification of sunrise, dragon-victor, and city-founder.

### 4. The Cadmeian Cycle: Semele, Actaeon, Dionysos (pp. 163–223)

**Semele** (= Ugaritic *Ṣml*, "Eagle-Mother"):
In the Ugaritic poem of Aqht, the goddess *Ṣml* is the "Mother of the Eagles" who swallowed the remains of the slain hero Aqht. In Greek myth, Semele swallows Dionysos's heart and becomes pregnant with his new incarnation.

> "Ṣml thus corresponds to Semele both by her name and by her function in the myth." (from Greek Names article, cf. p. 170)

**Actaeon** (= Ugaritic *Aqht*):
The proud young hunter torn apart by his hounds directly parallels Aqht, the proud young hunter slain for refusing to cede his bow to the goddess Anath. The name derives from extended forms *Aqhtn* or *Aqhtyn*.

**Dionysos** and his epithets:
- *Bakchos* = W-S *bākuy*, from root *bākâ*, "to weep" (cf. Hesychius: *bakchon* is Phoenician for "mourning")
- *Bassareus* / *Bassarids* = W-S *bāṣar*, "to cut, to tear to pieces"

The myth of Zagreus-Dionysos (dismembered and eaten by Titans) has close parallels in Ugaritic texts describing the fate of Aqht.

## Notable Passages

> "With all the recognized weaknesses of Herodotus, he still knew more about the Phoenicians than Beloch and his followers." (p. 113, quoting W.F. Albright)

> "We, thus, found what was to be proved—'dark waters' without any glimpse of light (the very *mêm-bli-ʾâr* we had discovered in Membliaros), and located, of all places, exactly at Membliaros-Anaphe." (p. 120)

> "Cadmos and Europa are the two aspects of the planet Venus, the Morning and the Evening Stars, which were first believed to be two distinct luminaries... According to the Babylonian conception, the planet Venus as the Morning Star was male, as the Evening Star female." (p. 153)

> "Such is the mythological essence of Cadmos. His name and almost all of his adventures and attributes are Oriental and originated in W-S myths of the god of sunrise, strongly influenced by the image of the Sumerian Ningišzida, the serpent-god of fertility, sunrise, and the building of cities." (p. 157)
