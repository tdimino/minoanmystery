## Overview

This section applies Astour's methodological principle—that names must be validated by *functional parallels*—to Bellerophon and his entire family tree. Astour demonstrates that Bellerophon's grandfather Sisyphos, grandmother Merope, and father Glaucos all bear names with Semitic healing-god connections. The section then analyzes the Bellerophon-Anteia conflict as a variant of the widespread Near Eastern "chaste youth slandered by rejected woman" motif (cf. Joseph and Potiphar's wife, Bata, Ešmun). The analysis extends to the Chimaera, Pegasos, and parallels with Hippolytos, Phaëthon, and the "flying heroes" (Icaros, Idas, Abaris).

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This section reveals that Greek hero myths—even those seemingly "native" like Bellerophon—preserve Near Eastern mythological structures, divine names, and cult patterns related to healing, the underworld, and the dying-and-rising god.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Sisyphos: The Exorcist-King (pp. 250–253)

Bellerophon's grandfather Sisyphos defies Greek etymology ("Very Very Wise One" < *sophos*). Astour derives him from Akkadian:

- **Etymology**: *šešup* = Š-stem permansive of *(w)ašapu* "to incant, to bewitch"
- **Meaning**: "The one producing incantations/witchcraft"
- **Cognates**: *āšipu* "exorcist-priest," *eššepu* "owl/exorcist"

**Mythological confirmation**:
- Sisyphos chained Death himself—the ultimate healing feat
- His city **Ephyra** = W-S *ʾäphurā* "dusty" = the Nether World (Akk. *Bît epri* "House of Dust")
- Brothers Cretheus and Salmoneus bear Semitic names
- Brother Athamas married Ino (Semitic goddess), father of Melicertes/Palaemon

> "Victory over Death, prolongation of human life was the greatest that was expected from a healing god." (p. 252)

### 2. Merope: The Healer-Wife (pp. 253–255)

Sisyphos's wife Merope (one of the Pleiades):

- **Etymology**: W-S *merappeʾ* "female healer" (< *rpʾ* "to heal")
- **Pleiades connection**: Babylonian *Sibittu* "the Heptad"—defenders against evil spirits; located near Scorpion constellation (symbol of healing goddess Išhara)
- **Father Atlas**: W-S El in his role as ocean-ruler (cognate with Ea, the *a-zu* "water-knower")

**Mythological function**: Merope helped Sisyphos escape Hades by deliberately omitting funeral rites, enabling his return. She "knew how to return dead men to life."

### 3. Glaucos: The Owl-Father (pp. 255–260)

Bellerophon's father Glaucos:

- **Etymology**: From *glaux* "owl" (not "grey sea")
- **Cognate with Sisyphos**: *glaux* corresponds to Akkadian *eššepu* "owl/exorcist"
- **Brother Ornytion**: Greek *ornithion* "bird"—confirming the bird-nature

**Mythological parallels**:
- Torn by maddened horses (= dismemberment/sparagmos)
- Same death as Hippolytos, Pentheus, Lycurgos
- Connected to the "dying god" pattern (Zagreus, *Rpu-Bʿl*)
- Worshipped at Corinth as *Taraxippos* (horse-frightening demon)

**Three Glaukoi** (variants of same figure):
1. Corinthian Glaucos (Bellerophon's father)
2. Boeotian sea-god Glaucos (fishtail, prophet, possesses plant of life)
3. Cretan Glaucos (Minos's son, revived by serpent's healing herb)

> "The name of Glaucos was a Greek one, and has a very transparent significance. It means 'rent by horses' and indicates the circumstances of the hero's death." (p. 259)

### 4. Bellerophon and Anteia: The Slandered Hero (pp. 260–270)

The core myth: Anteia (Proitos's wife) falsely accuses Bellerophon of attempted seduction.

**Near Eastern parallels**:
- Joseph and Potiphar's wife (Gen. 39:7-20)
- Bata in Egyptian *Tale of Two Brothers*
- Ešmun and Astronoë/Astarte
- Combabos (= Humbaba) and Stratonice
- Baal and Ašertu (Hittite version)
- Gilgameš and Ištar (tablet VI)

**The goddess behind Anteia**:
- *Anteia* = Greek rendering of **Anath** (*ʿAnat*, *ʿAntit*)
- Doublet name **Stheneboea** = "mighty cow" = epithet of Anath (cf. *Lʾt* "cow/mighty")
- Daughter **Maira** = W-S *maʿîrā* "the shining one" (Morning Star = Anath as Venus/*Kaukabtā*)

> "The wife of Proitos who slandered Bellerophon is called Anteia in the Iliad: this is a correct and precise rendering of the name of Anath." (p. 266)

### 5. Chimaera and Pegasos (pp. 270–277)

**Chimaera**: Not volcanic allegory but Semitic sea-monster:
- Etymology: W-S *ḥāmar* "to heave, to foam" (of sea)—cf. Habakkuk 3:15 *ḥōmer mayim rabbîm* "foaming of great waters"
- Related to Leviathan (*Ltn*), the seven-headed sea-dragon
- Fire-breathing matches Leviathan description (Job 41:11-13)
- Composite monsters (lion-goat-serpent) = Mesopotamian *Mischgestalten*

**Pegasos**: The winged horse:
- Iconographically Oriental (Assyrian seals show winged horses)
- Ugaritic text RS 24.244 mentions divinized horses, daughter of Sun-goddess
- "Daughter of the source, daughter of the Ocean" = Hesiod's Pegasos "born near the sources (*pēgai*) of Ocean"
- Horses sacred to the Sun (cf. II Kings 23:11)

### 6. Parallels: Hippolytos and Phaëthon (pp. 277–285)

**Hippolytos**:
- Same "slandered by rejected woman" motif (Phaedra)
- Same death by horses (= sparagmos)
- Dying god of Adonis type (Frazer)
- Name = "rent by horses" (describes death, not original name)

**Phaëthon** = Canaanite **Hêlêl ben Šaḥar** (Isaiah 14:12-15):
- *Phaëthōn* "the shining" = exact translation of *Hêlêl*
- Son of Eos (Dawn) = "son of Dawn" (*ben Šaḥar*)
- Ascension to heaven, fall to underworld
- Struck by Zeus's lightning

> "The name, image, and myth of Phaëthon go back to the Canaanite myth of Hêlêl ben Šahar 'Shining One, son of Dawn,' preserved as a fragment in Isaiah 14:12-15." (p. 280)

**The mythical river Eridanos**: Derives from Eridu (Ea's city), the river of the Nether World (*Hubur*).

### 7. Three More Flying Heroes (pp. 285–295)

**Icaros** = W-S *ʾikkâr* "farmer" (< Akkadian *ikkaru* < Sumerian ENGAR):
- Agrarian and chthonic motifs
- Erigone "the early born" (Dawn/Morning Star)
- Pestilence/healing themes
- Same heavenward flight, fall pattern

**Marpessa** = W-S *marpeʾ* "healer" + Greek feminine *-ssa*:
- Flew in winged chariot with husband Idas
- **Idas** = W-S *ydʿ* "to know" (cf. Amarna *Idamaras*)
- Idas possessed divine knowledge, struck by Zeus's thunder
- Father **Aphareus** = W-S *ʿāphār* "dust" (= Underworld)

**Abaris** = Hebrew *ʿābar* "to fly, soar":
- Hyperborean priest of Apollo
- Flew on golden arrow
- Healed diseases, saved Sparta from pestilence
- Built temple of Persephone the Savior

## Notable Passages

> "We have already seen that the cow was Anath's animal symbol and double, and that one of the W-S surnames of the goddess—*Lʾt* (Leah)—signified both 'cow' and 'mighty.'" (p. 266)

> "The Bellerophon story in the Iliad does not mention Pegasos and the ascension to heaven, but again it vaguely states that at the end 'he became hateful to all the gods' (VI:200)—the same expression which, in the very same conversation between Diomedes and Glaucos, is applied to Lycurgos who had attacked Dionysos (VI:138)." (p. 278)

> "Gruppe showed as early as 1906... that the name, image, and myth of Phaëthon go back to the Canaanite myth of Hêlêl ben Šaḥar 'Shining One, son of Dawn,' preserved as a fragment in Isaiah 14:12-15." (p. 280)

> "The derivation of the name Abaris from Heb. *ʿābar* 'to fly, to soar in the air,' imposes itself." (p. 293)
