## Overview

This section traces the healing-god origins of Jason ("the healer") and his entire mythological cycle. Astour begins with Iasion (lover of Demeter in the *hieros gamos*), demonstrates parallels with Hebrew Ruth-Boaz tradition, then shows that Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece derives from the Babylonian myth of Zû—the bird-god who stole the Tablets of Destinies. The section culminates in a systematic analysis of Semitic names in the "bird-family" of Aietes: Aietes the Eagle, Circe the She-Hawk, Chalciope ("hawk-faced"), Medea ("the flying one"), Absyrtos ("the dismembered"), and others.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This section reveals that the Argonaut myth—one of Greece's most celebrated epic cycles—is fundamentally a Near Eastern narrative about healer-gods, bird-deities, and the cosmic struggle for divine kingship (the Tablets of Destinies/Golden Fleece).

## Key Arguments

### 1. Iasion and the *Hieros Gamos* (pp. 276–278)

**Iasion** = Greek *iaomai* "to heal," *iasis* "healing, recovery"

Iasion's union with Demeter in the "thrice-ploughed fallow" (Odyssey V:125-128, Hesiod *Theog.* 969-974) represents the widespread agrarian rite of *hieros gamos*—sexual union in a freshly ploughed field to secure harvest through magic.

**Parallels**:
- His fruit **Plutos** ("wealth") = Pluto (king of Hades)—chthonic fertility-gods were considered rich, givers of harvest
- Death by Zeus's thunderbolt = same fate as Phaëthon, Idas, Asclepios—"obviously inherent to the cycle itself"
- Ugaritic verb *šlš* (from numeral "three") = "to plough"—the custom of ploughing thrice was common to Greece and Syria

> "The example of Iasion shows in relief the organic connection of the chthonic fertility-gods with healing, which often was an essential feature of their character." (p. 277)

### 2. Ruth-Boaz as Hebrew Eleusinian Parallel (pp. 278–279)

Astour identifies the Book of Ruth as "the Hebrew version of the Eleusis myth" in "fully euhemerized form":

| Eleusis | Bethlehem |
|---------|-----------|
| Demeter, depressed by loss of Cora | Naomi, depressed by loss of sons |
| Old harvest-goddess + young (Cora) | Old (Naomi) + young (Ruth) |
| *Hieros gamos* in thrice-ploughed field | *Hieros gamos* on threshing-floor |
| Triptolemos ("thrice-ploughed") | Boaz = *Ba'al 'Oz* ("strong Baal") |
| Demeter's relationship to foster-child | "There is a son born to Naomi" (Ruth 4:17) |

### 3. Jason and the Golden Fleece as Healing Implement (pp. 280–282)

**Jason** (*Iasôn*) = "healer" (almost identical to Iasion)

The Golden Fleece was not mere treasure but **magical medicine**:

> "The fleece—i.e., the hide together with the wool—of the freshly killed victims, played one of the most important rôles in the rite of purification... The fleece is not divine in our sense, not definitely either for blessing or for cursing; it is taboo, it is 'medicine,' it is magical." (p. 281, quoting Jane Harrison)

**Babylonian parallel**: "Fleece of the Great Bull" (*sugugallu*) was deified, identified with Anu himself—"this clarifies why the Golden Fleece plays the rôle of the Babylonian Tablets of Destinies in the Argonaut myth."

### 4. Aietes, Circe, and the Land of Aia (pp. 282–286)

**Aietes** (*Aiêtês*) = "eagle" (from *aêtos*)

**Aia**: Never had real geographical existence—a "fantastic country at the edge of the world." V. Bérard recognized:
- **Circe** (*Kirkê*) = feminine of *kirkos* "hawk"
- **Aiaie** = W-S *'Ay-'ayyâ* "island of the Hawk" (or *Aia* + Greek feminine ending *-ie*)

**Sun-god connection**: The iconographic idea of personifying the sun by a hawk penetrated from Egypt throughout the Near East. The sun-disc with hawk's wings was adopted by Hurrians, Hittites, Assyrians. West Semites were influenced by consonance of their word for hawk (*'ayyā*) with Babylonian goddess Aia, spouse of sun-god Šamaš.

> "The Sun-god was considered the ruler and patron of the inhabitants of Hades... at night, when all gods, identified with stars and planets, are in the sky, the Sun travels his path underground from West to East." (p. 287)

### 5. The Argonauts and the Myth of Zû (pp. 286–293)

**Central thesis**: The Argonaut plot is "entirely borrowed from the Babylonian one of the theft of the Tablets of Destinies by the bird-god Zû."

| Babylonian Zû Myth | Greek Argonaut Myth |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Zû steals Tablets of Destinies | Aietes holds Golden Fleece |
| Tablets = symbol of divine kingship | Fleece = symbol of royal power (cf. Atreus/Thyestes) |
| Zû = "doer of evil, who raises the head of evil" | Aietes = *oloophrōn* "of baneful mind" |
| Zû's wife seduced, Zû intoxicated | Dragon intoxicated by Medea's soporific |
| Tablets retrieved after Zû vanquished | Fleece retrieved after Jason's trials |

**Ugaritic parallel**: Anath boasts of crushing the "writhing serpent" and "powerful one of seven heads" (= Leviathan), then "I fought and I inherited gold"—the dragon-guarding-gold motif.

> "Jason, before he became in the epic the personification of the ideal of ancient Greek knights-errant, a kind of chairman of the Hellenic Round Table, had first of all been a healer-hero, a magic expeller of evil." (p. 282)

### 6. Semitisms in the Bird-Family of Aietes (pp. 294–298)

Astour systematically analyzes every name in Aietes' family:

**Aietes**: Either from W-S *'ayit* "bird of prey" (Hebrew), or the name confirms the mythological borrowing from Zû (*ZU* = Akkadian *idû* "to know")—matching wife **Idyia** "the one who knows."

**Chalciope** ("hawk-faced"): From *chalkis*, a word from the "language of gods" (= Semitic)—probably from Akkadian *halâqu* "to perish/destroy" or Hebrew *hălaq* "smooth, hairless" (bald head of vultures).

**Cytissoros**: *-issôros* = Ugaritic *'ṣr*, Akkadian *iṣṣuru* "bird"—determinative placed after the name as in cuneiform.

**Absyrtos**: *A-bsyr-tos* = prothetic *a-* + *bașur* (passive participle of *bṣr* "to cut, tear to pieces") + Greek suffix *-tos* = "the dismembered one"—matching his fate of being cut to pieces by Medea.

**Medea**: From W-S root *d'y* "to fly" (Hebrew *dā'â*, Ugaritic *diy* // *nšrm* "eagles"). Participle feminine Piel: *madīyat* > *Mēdeia* = "the flying one"—confirmed by her flying chariot driven by dragons.

### 7. The Flying Chariot Motif (pp. 297–298)

The flying chariot of Medea (also Phaëthon, Idas, Triptolemos) is not Greek invention but W-S:

**II Kings 2:11** (Elijah's ascension): "Behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by whirlwind into heaven."

> "It is more than probable that the Greeks of the Mycenaean Age, having borrowed the personages of their myths about healer gods and heroes from the East, have also simultaneously borrowed the motif of a flying chariot, too." (p. 298)

## Notable Passages

> "The book of Ruth tells—in a fully euhemerized form—the Hebrew version of the Eleusis myth. A more thoroughly comparative survey must be left for another opportunity. The rôle of Eleusis is played there by Bethlehem, the 'House of bread.'" (p. 279)

> "So the antagonist of Jason the 'healer,' the one from whom the Golden Fleece which he had illegally appropriated had to be extorted, corresponds both in name and mythological function to the Babylonian bird-god Zû." (p. 294)

> "The name of Mermeros has a purely Greek explanation: *mermeros* in epic poetry means 'causing anxiety, heavy, difficult, terrible'... But, nevertheless, the association of Mermeros with Ilos in the formula 'Ilos son of Mermeros' betrays the Oriental origin of both names." (p. 299)

> "Precisely because the Etruscans, migrants from Asia Minor, worshipped a hawk-goddess, several localities, including Mount Circaeum, received names connected with her; and precisely because of that the Greeks from neighboring Cumae... located the fabulous island of Homeric Circe there." (p. 285)

- **Cyrus H. Gordon**: Ugaritic textual parallels
- **Dossin**: God Mêr/Mermeri of Mari studies

### Disputes
- **Rationalistic interpretations**: That treat Aia as real geography (Colchis)
- **Pure Greek etymologies**: For names like Medea, Mermeros
