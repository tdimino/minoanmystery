## Overview

This opening section of Chapter III establishes the foundation for understanding Greek healer-heroes as derivatives of Semitic and Sumerian healing deities. Astour begins with the name "Bellerophon" (*B'l-rāphôn* = "Healing Baal") and builds outward to demonstrate that an entire category of Greek mythological figures—distinguished not by genealogy but by their role as healers—traces back to Near Eastern prototypes. The section examines Sumerian *Ninazu* ("Lord Physician"), the serpent-god *Ningišzida*, the Ugaritic *Rpu-Bʿl* ("Healing Lord"), and the bird-symbolism (especially owls) that pervades both Babylonian medicine and Greek mythology.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This section reveals that Greek healing mythology is deeply rooted in Semitic and Sumerian traditions, with the serpent (a key Minoan symbol) and the owl serving as cross-cultural symbols of healing and chthonic wisdom.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Bellerophon = *Baʿal-rāphôn* "Healing Baal" (pp. 225–235)

Astour refines H. Lewy's earlier Semitic etymology of Bellerophon:

- **Root**: W-S *rpʾ* "to heal" (not *rpy* "to sink")
- **Formation**: *Baʿal* + *rāphôn* = "Baal the Healer" or "Healing Lord"
- **Parallel**: Ugaritic personal name *Rpan* (UM 91:7), Akkadian *mRap-a-na*

The Greek rendering follows normal patterns:
- *a* > *e* common in Greek transcriptions (cf. *Ekdippa* < *ʿAkzib*)
- Double lambda compensates for dropped laryngal
- Variant *Ellerophontês* reflects alternate form *ʿEl-Rāphôn*

> "With the preceding emendations, the derivation of Bellerophôn from *Baʿal-rāphôn* is quite possible and regular. However, *comparaison n'est pas raison*... the principal and essential stress is put on the similarity and relationship not of names, but of mythical motifs." (p. 234)

**Methodological principle**: Etymology alone is insufficient; the *functional role* of the figure must also match.

### 2. Sumerian Healing Gods: Ninazu and Ningišzida (pp. 235–240)

Astour traces the Sumerian prototypes that influenced West Semitic healing gods:

**Ninazu** (*dNin-a-zu* "Lord Physician"):
- Name literally translates into W-S as *Baʿal-rāphôn*
- Conceived in Hades (chthonic nature)
- Prototype of many W-S healing deities

**Ningišzida** (*dNin-giš-zi(d)-da*):
- Son of Ninazu
- Symbol: serpent or two entwined serpents
- Depicted with serpents growing from shoulders
- Identified with serpent-deity Šeraḫ and constellation Hydra (*mulMuš*)
- Related to "tree" or "wooden pole" as vegetation symbol

> "As convincingly shown by Starcky in his excellent study, Ninazu was, most probably, the prototype of many, if not of all, W-S healing gods. His name literally means 'Lord Physician' and, translated into W-S, is actually found in different variants." (p. 237)

### 3. Ugaritic *Mš* = Sumerian *Muš* "Serpent" (pp. 240–245)

Astour demonstrates that the Ugaritic deity *Mš* (son of Baal and the heifer-goddess Anath) is the Sumerian serpent-god *Muš*:

**Phonetic correspondence**: Flawless—Ugaritic *š* = Sumerian *š* [sh]

**Evidence against Egyptian origin** (cf. Moses):
- No Egyptian divine/human names borrowed in Ugaritic texts
- Sumerian element prominent in Ugaritic pantheon

**Sumerian deities at Ugarit** (7 attested):
1. *Nkl-w-Ib* < *Ningal* + *enbu*
2. *Ušhry* < Išhara (healing goddess)
3. *Prgl* < Piri(g)gal "Great Lioness"
4. *Ppšr* < Pap-sukkal
5. *Pbl-mlk* < Pa-bil-sag
6. *Bʿlt-bhtm* < Nin-é-gal
7. *Mš* < Muš "serpent"

**Feminine form** *Mšt*: Appears in names *Mšt-Dnty* (wife of Danel) and *Mšt-Hry* (wife of Krt)—"she-serpent" with W-S feminine ending.

### 4. *Rpu-Bʿl* "Healing Baal" (pp. 245–249)

The Ugaritic *Rpu-Bʿl*, son of Baal and the heifer, is:
- Identical with *Mš* in the mythological plane
- A chthonic deity
- The exact W-S translation of Sumerian *Ninazu* ("Lord Physician")

This establishes the chain: **Ninazu** → **Rpu-Bʿl** → **Bellerophon**

### 5. Bird-Symbolism in Healing Magic (pp. 246–260)

Astour reveals the crucial role of nocturnal birds (especially owls) in Babylonian medicine and Greek mythology:

**Akkadian owl-terms**:
- *kâsu* / *kôs* "owl" → Greek island **Kôs** (sacred to Asclepios)
- *eššepu* "owl" AND "exorcist-priest"
- *anpatu* → Greek **Anaphê** (island) and *'ânâphâ* (Heb. bird-name)

**The Coan Myth Cycle** (Antoninus Liberalis):
- King Merops (= *merappeʾ* "healer") changed into eagle
- Son Eumelos → *nyktikorax* (owl)
- Son Agron → *charadrios* (night-bird)
- Daughter Meropis → *glaux* (owl)
- Daughter Byssa → *bûṣu* (owl)

> "This local myth from the island of Asclepios is very significant. It not only reveals its Semitic toponymics, but also shows how strong the Semitic impact was precisely in the cycle referring to the sphere of chthonic healing-spirits, personified in Cos—as in Babylon—as nocturnal birds of prey." (p. 256)

**Athena's owl**: Not accidental but inherited from Near Eastern bird-goddesses. *Glaukōpis* = "owl-eyed/owl-faced," not "grey-eyed."

## Notable Passages

> "The establishment of an etymology is only the first step; the principal work is thereby only begun." (p. 225)

> "The serpent always was, among all ancient Mediterranean peoples, the symbol of the chthonic underworld gods, the givers of fertility, harvest, and healing." (p. 72, referenced p. 240)

> "The owl was an emblem of recovery and prosperity exactly as Athena's other emblem, the serpent, was. Athena herself was originally imagined as an owl—it's in this sense that her surname *glaukōpis* has to be understood: it means precisely 'owl-eyed,' or 'owl-faced,' or 'owl-shaped,' and not 'grey-eyed,' as usually translated." (p. 257)

> "The healer-heroes of Greek myths carrying the names of *Glaukos* also derive from the 'owl,' and not from the 'grey sea.'" (p. 257)
