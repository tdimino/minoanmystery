## Overview

This section culminates Astour's analysis of Greek healer-heroes by tracing Cheiron (the centaur who taught medicine to Achilles and Asclepios) to the Sumerian scorpion-god Pabilsag, and by demonstrating that Asclepios—Greece's supreme healer-god—has Mesopotamian and Canaanite origins revealed through his symbols (serpent-staff, dog), his mythology (exposed child, death by thunderbolt, resurrection), and his very name (derived from Ugaritic priestly terminology for ritual prostration). The section concludes with a comprehensive summary of the entire chapter's thesis on healer-heroes.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This section completes the chain connecting Greek healing mythology to Mesopotamian origins via West Semitic intermediaries, demonstrating that even the most revered Greek medical god—Asclepios—derives from Near Eastern prototypes.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Cheiron = Pabilsag = Pbl-mlk (pp. 299–303)

**Comparative astrology**: The Greeks identified Cheiron with Sagittarius, which they borrowed (like most astral notions) from Babylonians. The Babylonians represented Sagittarius as a scorpion-man with a bow, named after the god **Pabilsag**.

**Pabilsag** (Sum. *dPa-bil-sag*):
- Husband of healing-goddesses (Ninkarrak/Nin-isinna)
- Located next to Scorpio (constellation of healing goddess Išhara) and Hydra (Ningišzida)
- "Explains why Cheiron-Sagittarius was considered the teacher of the ophic healer-god Asclepios"

**Ugaritic evidence**: Pbl-mlk in the *Krt* epic = Pabilsag. Virolleaud's identification: "Pbl is the Sumerian Pabil-sag 'Pabil (is) the chief.'"

> "Pbl-mlk, king of Udm, figures in the epic of King Krt, and it was his beautiful elder daughter Mšt-Hry whom Krt married." (p. 302)

**Mšt-Hry** = "fiery serpent" (*Mušt-Harayyā*) = constellation Hydra—daughter of Pabilsag/Sagittarius.

### 2. Etymology of Cheiron from *Hyyn* (pp. 303–305)

Greek etymology *cheir* "hand" (surgeon) is contradicted by Attic spelling *Chirôn* (never *chir* for "hand"). Astour proposes Ugaritic personal name **Hyyn** as source:

**Two etymological possibilities**:

1. From *ḥyr* "to choose" (Akkadian *ḫâru*) → *ḫâwiru/ḫâ'iru* "husband"
   - Pabilsag was husband of Ninkarrak; their *hierogamy* was a popular feast at Isin
   - Scorpions symbolized mating; Išḥara was patroness of marriage consummation
   - Cheiron advised Peleus on seizing Thetis; their wedding was celebrated at his cave

2. From Arabic *ḫair* "good, excellent, beneficent, benevolent"
   - "An excellent name for a god of health, fertility, abundance, and help to humans"
   - Attested in Aramaic personal names: *Ḥyr, Ḥyr', Ḥyrw, Ḥyrn*

### 3. Asclepios: Symbol and Mythology (pp. 305–309)

**Serpent-staff emblem**:
- "This very emblem—a bronze serpent on a staff—was worshipped in the temple of Jerusalem until about 700; its creation was ascribed to the great thaumaturge and healer, the ophic hero Moses" (II Kings 18:4; Num. 21:8)
- Phoenician coins show Ešmun with serpent-staff
- Šed-râphe' at Palmyra depicted with serpent coiled around spear
- "The way by which the old Sumerian emblem penetrated into Greece is clear"

**Dog emblem**:
- Goddess Gula, "the great physician," had the dog as her emblem
- Depicted on Cassite-period *kudurrus* like Asclepios at Epidauros: sitting on throne with dog at feet
- Clay figurines of magic dogs ("he who bites his adversaries") were Babylonian talismans against disease

**Birth mythology parallels**:
- Exposed child nursed by goat = Sumerian Ningirsu
- Nursed by turtle-dove = Semiramis legend from Ascalon
- Found in chest = Sargon I, Moses, Adonis
- Lightning flashing from child = divine origin marker

### 4. Coronis, Phlegyas, and the Double Genealogy (pp. 309–313)

**Coronis** (Asclepios's mother):
- Common etymology: *korônê* "crow"
- Astour's alternative: *korônis* = "cow with concave and crescent-shaped horns" (Hesychius)
- = W-S *'Aštart Qarnayim* "two-horned Astarte"
- Alternative name **Aigla** = possibly W-S *'eglā* "heifer"
- Matches Ugaritic myth of cow-goddess giving birth to *Rpu-Bʿl* "lord-healer"

**Phlegyas** (Coronis's father):
- *phlegyas* = "eagle" (Hesiod *Scutum Herc.* 134)
- Also from *phlego* "to burn, flame" = Canaanite god **Rešeph** (*rešeph* "flame, lightning, fever")
- Rešeph corresponded to Sumero-Akkadian Nergal (pestilence, underworld, war)
- Son of Ares—who is also similar to Rešeph/Nergal

**Double genealogy of Asclepios**:
- Variant 1: Son of Apollo (Greek identification of Rešeph)
- Variant 2: Great-grandson of Ares (another Rešeph identification)
- In Orchomenos: directly son of Ares, under name **Ascalaphos**

> "The two variants are reduced to one: there is no essential difference, but only onomastic hesitation in translating the original Rešeph into Greek." (p. 312)

### 5. Ascalaphos = Asclepios = Ninazu (pp. 313–316)

**Ascalaphos** (Nether World deity):
- Son of Acheron (river of Hades)—*Acherôn* < W-S *'aḥărôn* "western" (Hades was in Far West)
- Mother: Gorgyrê ("underground") or Orphnê ("darkness")
- Denounced Persephone for eating pomegranate seed
- Transformed into *askalaphos* (short-eared owl)

**Key correspondence**:
- Acheron = Hubur (Sumerian river of Hades)
- Ninlil's son by the underworld river-god = **Ninazu** "Lord Physician"
- "Ascalaphos, the son of Hades-river Acheron, thus fully corresponds to Ninazu"

> "This striking correspondence finally establishes beyond any doubt the identity Asclepios = Ascalaphos = Ninazu." (p. 316)

### 6. Etymology of Asclepios (pp. 316–319)

**Problem**: "The name of Asclepios absolutely does not surrender to even the remotest Greek etymology."

**Solution**: From Akkadian priestly terminology:
- *labānu appi* = "to fall with the face down" (ritual prostration)
- Goes back to Sumerian *KA.SU.GAL*
- Ugaritic verb *ql/qll* "to fall," Š-stem *šql* "to cause to fall"
- 1st person imperfect: ***ašql-ap** = "I prostrate myself" (literally: "I cause my face to fall down")

**Corroboration**: Personal name from Alalah: *A-aš-qa-li-ia*—hypocoristic constructed with 1st person imperfect of *šql*.

> "Our restoration presents a full coincidence with Askalaphos, and, consequently, with Asklépios... It harmonizes with the symbol of Asclepios, with the Mesopotamo-Syrian origin of all details of his image, myth, pedigree, symbols." (p. 318)

### 7. Machaon: Possible "Reviver" Etymology (pp. 319–320)

**Machaon** (Asclepios's son, surgeon in *Iliad*):
- Common etymology: from *machomai* "to fight" (but this means "fight," not "cut")
- Astour's proposal: W-S *mḥwy* "reviver" (Piel participle of *ḥwy* "to live") + suffix *-n*
- = **Maḥawwôn* → Mycenaean *Ma-ka-wo* → *Macha(w)ôn*
- Matches ability ascribed to Asclepios and Oriental healer-gods to revive the dead

## Notable Passages

> "We found that some of the characters examined ultimately derived from different avatars of the Sumerian chthonic serpent-god (also worshipped as a wooden pole), some—from another favorite symbol of Sumerian healer-gods: owls, eagles, and other predatory birds, and one, the Centaur Cheiron, from the Sumerian scorpion-man, the god Pabilsag." (p. 320)

> "Fear of disease and death belongs among the strongest impulses of human nature, and it is natural, when seeking help and comfort, to turn towards countries with an immemorially ancient civilization and an age-old reputation of possessing great and mysterious wisdom." (p. 320)

> "Long before the 'Chaldean'—the magician and astrologist—was received with honor in Roman society, Sumero-Akkadian magic medicine, half-assimilated and refashioned by the Phoenicians and North Syrians, made its first invasion on the continent of Europe." (p. 321)

> "We were always able to establish that the link between Babylonia and Greece had been Canaan (in the widest sense of this term). Sometimes, no precise epigraphic evidence was extant on Canaanite ground—but the W-S mediation manifested itself in proper names." (p. 321)
