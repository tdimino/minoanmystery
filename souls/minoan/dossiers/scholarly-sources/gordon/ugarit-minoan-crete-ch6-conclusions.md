## Overview

This concluding chapter synthesizes Gordon's central thesis: Ugaritic literature bridges the gap between Homer and the Bible, demonstrating that Greek and Hebrew civilizations emerged from a shared East Mediterranean cultural matrix. Gordon argues that the Helen-of-Troy motif links the Epic of Kret, the Iliad, and the Patriarchal narratives of Genesis. He explains the anti-Canaanite polemic in the Ten Commandments (particularly the prohibition against coveting) as a reaction to Ugaritic values where Baal was described as a "coveting god." Finally, he traces the transmission of Hurrian theogonic myths (Kumarbi/Zeus) through Minoan Crete to Hesiod.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter represents the culmination of Gordon's argument—that the earliest Greek and Hebrew literatures share a common Northwest Semitic ("Phoenician") foundation transmitted through Minoan Crete. The craftsman traditions embodied by Kothar-wa-Hasis, Daedalus, and Bezalel are part of this shared heritage.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Helen-of-Troy Motif as Pan-Mediterranean Epic Pattern

**Thesis**: The same narrative pattern—kings wresting a beautiful wife—appears in Greek epic, Ugaritic epic, and Hebrew patriarchal narrative.

**The three manifestations:**
| Text | King | Wife | Foreign Power |
|------|------|------|---------------|
| Iliad | Menelaus | Helen | Priam's Troy |
| Epic of Kret | Kret | Hurrai | Pbl's Udum |
| Genesis 12, 20 | Abraham | Sarah | Pharaoh/Abimelech |

**Key quote**: "The Epic of Kret, with its Helen-of-Troy motif, anticipates the greatest epic of the West—Homer's Iliad. At the same time it shows quite plainly what had not been seen before: that the same motif forms a major strand in the Patriarchal Narratives of Genesis wherein kings wrest the beautiful Sarah from Abraham, the progenitor of kings."

**Significance**: "This Ugaritic parallel is particularly important because it is simultaneously associated with Greek and Hebrew literatures. Ugarit is the best-known link between the two."

### 2. The Tenth Commandment: Anti-Canaanite Polemic

**Thesis**: The prohibition against coveting was specifically directed against Canaanite religious values, where coveting was honorable.

**Evidence:**
- The Ugaritic texts describe Baal as a "coveting god" using the same word (*hmd*) as in the Ten Commandments
- In Canaan, coveting was not opprobrious—it was a divine attribute

**Contrast with other commandments:**
- "Not to steal or commit adultery" = universal, enforceable by law
- "Not even to covet" = specifically anti-Canaanite, unenforceable

**Key quote**: "In Canaan 'coveting' was not opprobrious. To the contrary, the Ugaritic texts tell us that Baal was a coveting god, using the same word (hmd) as in the Ten Commandments. Accordingly, the emphasis on not coveting in Israel was prompted in opposition to the honored values of pagan Canaan."

### 3. The Hurrian Channel: Kumarbi to Zeus via Minoan Crete

**Thesis**: The Hesiodic theogony (Zeus displacing Cronus) derives from the Hurrian Kumarbi myth, transmitted through Minoan Crete.

**The correspondences:**
| Hurrian | Greek |
|---------|-------|
| Kumarbi | Cronus |
| Teshub | Zeus |

**The channel of transmission**: "The Minoan texts from Hagia Triada, Crete, contain two unmistakable Hurrian names, so that now we have the channel of transmission."

**Key quote**: "Hesiod (lines 477 and 480) locates the story on Crete. The Minoan texts from Hagia Triada, Crete, contain two unmistakable Hurrian names, so that now we have the channel of transmission. It now appears that the Hurrian minority on Minoan Crete introduced the myth to the Aegean."

### 4. The Mediterranean Synthesis

**Thesis**: The earliest Greek and Hebrew literatures emerged from an international East Mediterranean culture that had already absorbed the heritages of Sumer, Akkad, Egypt, and Canaan.

**The synthesis:**
- Sumero-Akkadian heritage (east)
- Egyptian legacy (west)
- Canaanite cultural matrix (center)

**Implication for methodology:**
> "The earliest Greek and earliest Hebrew literatures can be used to elucidate each other in the same way that Hittite records have been used to clarify Mycenaean Greek history, or that Egyptian and cuneiform texts have been brought to bear on early biblical problems."

**Key quote**: "Neither Greece nor Israel had to go abroad to borrow the rich contributions of Babylonia, the Nile Valley and other civilized areas of the Near East. The Sumero-Akkadian, Egyptian, Canaanite, and other heritages were built into the international culture entrenched on Greek and Palestinian soil before the Greeks and Hebrews of the Heroic Age in the second millennium appeared as historic entities."

### 5. The Phoenician Foundation of Greece

**Thesis**: From ca. 1800 to ca. 1400 BC, Greece was dominated by Northwest Semites ("Phoenicians"), linking it linguistically and culturally with the Semitic Levant.

**Key quote**: "Thanks to the Minoan texts we know that from about 1800 to about 1400 B.C., Greece was dominated by Northwest Semites ('Phoenicians'), who linked it linguistically and culturally with the whole Semitic Levant."

## Notable Passages

> "Ugaritic literature has bridged the gap between Homer and the Bible."

— *Context*: The central thesis statement of the entire book, encapsulated in one sentence.

> "No serious study of Western civilization can afford to disregard this fully established, but as yet insufficiently recognized, fact."

— *Context*: Gordon's challenge to scholars who continue to treat Greek and Hebrew traditions as independent.

> "There is no longer any barrier between the early cultures of Europe and those of the Near East. Each is part of the same Mediterranean synthesis, whose written history begins in the Early Bronze Age (third millennium B.C.) and whose prehistory is attested by artifacts in the fourth millennium B.C."

— *Context*: The methodological conclusion—that artificial disciplinary barriers between Classics and Near Eastern Studies must fall.

> "The Minoan texts demonstrate that essentially the same language and civilization permeated 'Greece,' before Greece was Greek."

— *Context*: The final sentence of the book's conclusion, asserting the Semitic character of pre-Greek "Greece."
