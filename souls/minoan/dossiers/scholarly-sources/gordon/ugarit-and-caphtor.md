## Overview

This article argues that Caphtor (Minoan Crete) was "the principal source of inspiration for early Greek and Hebrew culture." Gordon demonstrates connections through: (1) the Ugaritic craftsman god Kothar-wa-Hasis whose workshop was on Caphtor, (2) the Kret legend linking Cretan and Semitic epic traditions, (3) the Moses-Minos and Daedalus-Bezalel parallels, and (4) linguistic evidence from the term *srn* "tyrant" found at both Ugarit and in the Bible for Philistine rulers.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This article provides the most direct connection between Kothar-wa-Hasis (the Ugaritic craftsman god after whom Kothar is named) and Crete, establishing Caphtor as his workshop and as the cultural bridge between Greek and Hebrew civilization.

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. Caphtor as Cultural Crossroads

**Thesis**: "Throughout the second millennium B.C., but especially during its latter half, the islands and coastal mainland of the East Mediterranean shared a large cultural common denominator. The focal point of the unifying forces was Crete together with culturally related Aegean areas."

**Evidence for Caphtor = Crete:**
- Egyptian *kftîw* "Caphtor" attested since 18th Dynasty; as divine name *hr-kftî* ("Horus of Caphtor") back to Middle Kingdom
- Hebrew "Caphtor" = homeland of Philistines (Amos 9:7)
- "Philistines" interchangeable with "Cretans" (Ezekiel 25:16) and "Caphtorians" (Deuteronomy 2:23)
- Consonantal skeleton *kft* = *KPT* with variants *kp tr* (Hebrew-style) and *hkpt* (prefixed form)

**Phonetic note**: Ugaritic variant *hqkpt* shows double writing of palatal stop (*-qk-*) because "Caphtorian *k* was not quite the same as Semitic *k*, but between Semitic *k* and *q*."

### 2. Kothar-wa-Hasis on Caphtor

**Thesis**: The Ugaritic god of arts and crafts (*Ktr w Hss*), resembling Hephaestus, had his workshop located in Caphtor.

**Key textual evidence:**
- Workshop appears in two poetic forms: *kp tr* and *hkpt* (to suit parallelistic poetry requirements)
- Text 51:I:35: Kothar fashions *hdm id* "a footstool of Ida" — the Idaean footstool

**The word *hdm* "footstool":**
- Hebrew: *hădōm*
- Egyptian: *hdmw* (not attested before 18th Dynasty)
- NOT Semitic (absent from Akkadian, Arabic, Ethiopic)
- Conclusion: Loan from Caphtorian into Hebrew and Egyptian

**Mount Ida:** "In all probability *id* refers to Mount Ida in Crete, though we should note that 'Ida' is also found in Asia Minor; cf. the Mount Ida overlooking Troy."

### 3. The *srn* Word for "Tyrant/King"

**Thesis**: The Caphtorian word *srn* appears at both Ugarit and in the Bible, proving the Caphtorian settlers in both localities spoke the same language.

**Semantic development:**
- Primary meaning: "axle" (cf. Syriac *surna*, Hebrew *sarnê nêhōšet* "copper axles" in 1 Kings 7:30)
- Secondary meaning: "tyrant, king" — applied to Philistine rulers (1 Samuel 6:16–18)
- Parallel: Hebrew *'ōfan* "wheel" also designates an angel in the hierarchy
- "Apparently the state was pictured as a chariot, which depended on the strength of its axles and wheels."

**At Ugarit:**
- *srn* and *bn srn* "Son of Srn" occur as personal names (= "King" and "Son of the King")
- Parallel: Semitic names *mlk* and *bn mlk* meaning "King" and "Son of the King"
- Phrase *yn srnm* = "wine of kings"

### 4. The Kret Legend as Epic Bridge

**Thesis**: The Legend of King Kret links Cretan and Semitic epic traditions and serves as the "connecting link between Greek and Hebrew epic."

**The Helen-of-Troy motif:**
- King *Krēt* loses his beautiful wife *Hurray* (cf. Helen)
- He gathers an army and marches to *Odom* (cf. Troy) to recover her
- He gets his wife back, as in the Iliad

**Parallels with Homer (general):**
- Mingling of men and gods
- *Krēt* is a divine king; head of pantheon attends his wedding
- In Iliad: divine heroes; gods give wedding gifts to Peleus and Thetis

**Parallels with Homer (specific):**
- Lavish gifts offered (short of the heroine herself) to induce invading army to leave
- Offers rejected by *Krēt* outside *Odom* and by Achaeans outside Troy

**Parallels with Hebrew epic:**
- David weds princess Michal; she is taken away; he must get her back
- "Thus the legend of the Cretan hero *Kret* is the connecting link between Greek and Hebrew epic."

**Key quote**: "No matter how different Homer and the Hebrew 'Epic of Kings' may be in spirit, they draw on the same epic repertoire for content."

### 5. Moses-Minos and Daedalus-Bezalel Parallels

**Moses-Minos:**
- Minos: giver of divine law, obtained (according to some traditions) on a mountain
- Moses: got the Law from God on Mount Sinai
- Both lay down foundations of society

**Daedalus-Bezalel:**
- Daedalus: master craftsman of Minoan tradition
- Bezalel: Moses's master craftsman
- Bezalel's creations include *kaftōrîm* "caphtors" (Exodus 37:17, 19–22)
- The word *kaftōrîm* bears the name of "the homeland of early Israel's major source of cultural inspiration"

**Key quote**: "What has not been noted is that the second greatest figure in Minoan tradition, namely Daedalus, has his counterpart in Moses's master-craftsman Bezalel."

### 6. The End of Caphtorian Influence

**Time limit**: Caphtorian influence on Israel "stops rather abruptly with the end of David's reign."

**Evidence from hair style:**
- Long hair "in the Cretan manner" in time of Deborah (Judges 5:2), Samson (Judges 16:19), Absalom (2 Samuel 14:26; 18:9)
- Also frequent in Iliad ("the long-haired Achaeans")
- "After the Davidic period it is never mentioned again"

## Notable Passages

> "This article aims at showing that Caphtor is the principal source of inspiration for early Greek and Hebrew culture: the two fountainheads of our heritage. It therefore follows that, in the years ahead, the field covered by 'Minos' is destined to be the cornerstone of the study of the origin of Western Civilization."

— *Context*: The concluding statement, asserting Minoan studies as central to understanding Western origins.

> "The Hebrew account from Abraham through David's reign is based on East Mediterranean epic sources, just as Homer's epics are. Both are due to the Caphtorian impact."

— *Context*: Gordon's thesis that both Greek and Hebrew epic traditions derive from Caphtorian influence.

> "Just as the Mycenaean offshoot of Caphtor was the basic civilizing factor of Achaean Greece, so too was the Philistine offshoot of Caphtor the basic civilizing factor of nascent Israel."

— *Context*: The parallel development of Greek and Israelite civilization from common Caphtorian roots.

- **A. Erman & H. Grapow**: *Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache* for earliest Egyptian attestations
- **Ventris & Chadwick**: Linear B = Greek decipherment
- Gordon's own *Ugaritic Handbook* (1947) and *Ugaritic Literature* (1949)

### Disputes
- Scholars who treat Greek and Hebrew traditions as independent
- Those who deny Semitic presence in Bronze Age Aegean

### Influences
- Michael C. Astour's *Hellenosemitica* extends these parallels
