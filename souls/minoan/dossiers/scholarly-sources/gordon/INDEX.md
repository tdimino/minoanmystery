# Cyrus H. Gordon (1908–2001)

## Scholar Profile

- **Full Name**: Cyrus Herzl Gordon
- **Dates**: 1908–2001
- **Affiliation**: Brandeis University (Department of Mediterranean Studies, founder); later New York University
- **Training**: University of Pennsylvania (PhD 1930, Assyriology under Ephraim Avigdor Speiser)
- **Languages**: Ugaritic, Hebrew, Akkadian, Hurrian, Linear A/B, Egyptian hieroglyphs, plus modern scholarly languages

## Why Gordon Matters for Kothar

Gordon is the primary architect of the Minoan-Semitic thesis—the argument that Minoan civilization was linguistically and culturally Northwest Semitic (Phoenician). His work provides Kothar with:

1. **Linear A decipherment** - Semitic readings of Minoan syllabary based on the acrophony principle (MAN = *bu* from *bunushu*, BOAT = *si* from *sipinatu*)
2. **Kothar-wa-Hasis connection** - The Ugaritic craftsman god whose workshop was located on Caphtor (Crete), fashioning the "Idaean footstool"
3. **Moses-Minos parallel** - Law-giver traditions connecting Sinai and Knossos
4. **Daedalus-Bezalel parallel** - Master craftsmen creating *kaftôrîm* (Caphtorian work)
5. **Helen-of-Troy motif** - Epic pattern linking Homer, the Kret legend, and Genesis

As founder of the Mediterranean Studies department at Brandeis and mentor to Michael C. Astour, Gordon established the institutional and intellectual framework for the Hellenosemitic thesis that Astour would extend.

## Biography

Born in Philadelphia, Gordon received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1930, studying Assyriology under E. A. Speiser. He excavated at Ur with Leonard Woolley and worked extensively on the newly discovered Ugaritic tablets from Ras Shamra. His *Ugaritic Handbook* (1947) and *Ugaritic Literature* (1949) became standard references.

Gordon founded the Department of Mediterranean Studies at Brandeis University, where he trained a generation of scholars in comparative Semitic studies. His controversial thesis that Linear A represents a Northwest Semitic language brought him into conflict with classicists but gained support from Semitists who recognized the linguistic parallels.

> "The Minoan script is essentially a syllabary... Minoan writing is pictographic in origin. Each phonetic value is derived from the opening consonant + vowel of the word depicted, in Northwest Semitic, specifically in a dialect close to Ugaritic." (*Ugarit and Minoan Crete*, Chapter III)

## Core Methodology

### The Acrophony Principle

Gordon's key insight: Linear A/B syllabic values derive from the initial consonant-vowel of Northwest Semitic words depicted by the pictographic signs.

**Examples:**
- MAN sign = *bu* (from Ug. *bunushu* "man")
- BOAT sign = *si* (from Ug. *sipinatu* "boat")
- APPLE sign = *tu* (from Ug. *tuppuhu* "apple")
- BIRD-OF-PREY sign = *ku* (from Ug. *kudru* "bird of prey")

This explains why Ventris's cryptanalytic values (determined without knowledge of Semitic) yield Semitic readings when applied to Linear A.

### Bilingual Method

Gordon used Greek-Eteocretan bilinguals from Dreros to confirm Semitic readings:
- Dreros First Bilingual: Greek *matri* "for mother" = Eteocretan *lmo* = Hebrew *l-immō* "for his mother"
- Dreros Second Bilingual: Greek *génoito* "let there be" = Eteocretan *ihia* = Hebrew *yihye* "it will be"

### Continuity Thesis

Minoan → Eteocretan → Phoenician represents one continuous Northwest Semitic language, attested in syllabic script (Linear A, 2000–1400 BC), then in Greek letters (Eteocretan, 600–300 BC), persisting on Crete until Hellenistic times.

## Key Contributions by Work

### Evidence for the Minoan Language (1966)

**Full Title**: *Evidence for the Minoan Language*

**Publisher**: Ventnor Publishers, Ventnor, N.J.

**Date**: 10 February 1966

**Core Thesis**: Linear A and Eteocretan are Northwest Semitic (Phoenician type), proven through bilingual analysis (Amathus, Dreros) and contextual decipherment. The Minoans were NW Semites expelled from the Egyptian Delta at the end of the First Intermediate Period.

**Structure** (16 chapters in 3 dossiers):
- **Part 1** (Ch. I–VII): Bilingual method — Eteocypriote, Eteocretan texts, orthography, morphology
- **Part 2** (Ch. VIII–XIII): Linear A decipherment — virtual bilinguals, vocabulary, names index
- **Part 3** (Ch. XIV–XVI): Phaistos Disc acrophony, Delta hypothesis, dialect synthesis

**Key readings**:
- Dreros: *lmo* = לְאִמּוֹ "for his mother," *ihia* = יִהְיֶה "it will be"
- Linear A: *ku-ro* = כֹּל "all," *ya-ta-no* = יָתַן "he gave," *ki-re-ya-tu* = קִרְיָה "city"
- Names: *da-we-da* = דוד "David" (4 occurrences), *a-du* = Addu/Baal (most frequent deity)

### Ugarit and Minoan Crete (1966)

**Full Title**: *Ugarit and Minoan Crete: The Bearing of Their Texts on the Origins of Western Culture*

**Publisher**: W. W. Norton & Company, New York

**Core Thesis**: Northwest Semitic "Delta folk" founded Minoan civilization around 1800 BC, bringing palace architecture, the syllabic script, and Canaanite religion to Crete. This explains the continuity between Ugaritic literature and both Greek epic (Homer) and Hebrew scripture.

- **Chapter I**: Ugarit and Its Significance—the crossroads position of Ugarit in the Amarna Age
- **Chapter II**: Ugaritic Literature and Greco-Hebrew Affinities—guild mobility, parallel word pairs, Semele/Dionysus
- **Chapter III**: Minoan Crete—the core decipherment chapter with acrophony, Linear A readings, Eteocretan bilinguals, Hagia Triada deity names
- **Chapter IV**: Ugaritic Poetry—Baal-Mot cycle, Yamm myths, Kret epic, Aqhat epic
- **Chapter V**: Prose Texts—administrative tablets, diplomatic correspondence
- **Chapter VI**: Conclusions—synthesis of the Minoan-Semitic thesis

### Minoica (JNES 1962)

**Key methodological statement**: Establishes Linear A as "West Semitic, of the Phoenician type" through analysis of dedicatory formulas.

**Key readings:**
- *ki-re-ya-tu* = קִרְיָה (*qiryat*) "city"
- *ya-ne* = יַיִן (*yayin*) "wine"
- *bi-ti za* = בַּיִת זֶה "this house"
- *ya-ta-no-L88* = form of *ytn* "to give/donate" (cf. Phoenician Karatepe texts)

### Ugarit and Caphtor (*Minos* journal)

**Core thesis**: "Caphtor is the principal source of inspiration for early Greek and Hebrew culture: the two fountainheads of our heritage."

**Key arguments:**
- Kothar-wa-Hasis (*Ktr w Hss*) has his workshop on Caphtor, fashioning the "Idaean footstool" (*hdm id*)
- The word *srn* "tyrant/king" (Philistine rulers) appears at Ugarit and in the Bible
- The Kret legend links Cretan and Semitic epic traditions
- Moses-Minos parallel: both law-givers received divine law on a mountain
- Daedalus-Bezalel parallel: both master craftsmen, and Bezalel creates *kaftôrîm*

### The Decipherment of Minoan and Eteocretan (JRAS 1975)

**Technical methodology**: Six methods for decipherment—(1) bilinguals, (2) inner variants, (3) parallel unilinguals, (4) syllabary variants, (5) graphic similarity to Linear B, (6) contextual analysis.

**Key bilingual readings:**
- Dreros First: Greek *matri* = Eteocretan *lmo* = Hebrew *l-immō*
- Psychro stone: *epithi* = *i-pi-ti* "engraved stone" (cf. Phoenician *pth*)

## Scholarly Lineage

### Builds On
- **E. A. Speiser**: Assyriology training, Hurrian studies
- **Leonard Woolley**: Ur excavations, material culture
- **Charles Virolleaud**: Ugaritic textual publication
- **Arthur Evans**: Minoan archaeology (though Gordon disputed Evans's linguistic conclusions)

### Disputes
- **Classical consensus**: That Minoan was pre-Indo-European or related to Anatolian languages
- **Ventris-Chadwick**: Gordon accepted their Linear B = Greek decipherment but argued Linear A was Semitic, not a related "Minoan Greek"
- **Separatist scholars**: Who maintained Greek and Hebrew traditions developed independently

### Influences
- **Michael C. Astour**: Gordon's student, extended the Hellenosemitic thesis in *Hellenosemitica* (1965)
- **Anson Rainey**: Gordon's student, Amarna letters specialist
- **Comparative mythologists**: Working on Greek-Near Eastern literary connections
- **Biblical scholars**: Recognizing Ugaritic parallels to Hebrew poetry and narrative
