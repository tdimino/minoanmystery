## Overview

This introductory chapter establishes the historical significance of Ugarit as the crossroads of Bronze Age civilizations. Gordon describes the 1928 discovery, the rapid decipherment of Ugaritic cuneiform, and Ugarit's position at the center of the "Amarna Order"—the international synthesis linking Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Hittites, and the Sea People. He argues that Ugarit provides the common backdrop to both Greek and Hebrew literatures, and explicitly challenges scholars who wish to keep Minoan civilization "free of Asiatic—and particularly Semitic—'contamination.'"

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter establishes the methodological framework for the entire book—Ugarit as the link between East and West Mediterranean, and the argument that relationship and individuality are not mutually exclusive.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Discovery of Ugarit (1928–1930)

**Narrative**: In 1928, a peasant accidentally plowed into an ancient Mycenaean-style tomb near the Syrian coast. French authorities sponsored excavations at Ras Shamra ("Fennel Head"), the mound marking ancient Ugarit.

**Rapid decipherment:**
- Cuneiform tablets in a new script discovered early 1929
- Published by Charles Virolleaud before the close of 1929
- Three scholars independently deciphered the script in 1930:
  1. Hans Bauer (first to publish)
  2. Edouard Dhorme (second)
  3. Charles Virolleaud (third)

**Key quote**: "It is to the lasting credit of French scholarship that the tablets were published in record time before the close of 1929."

### 2. Ugarit at the Crossroads

**Thesis**: Ugarit derived its importance from its location at the center of what was destined to become the cradle of Western civilization.

**The International Order (ca. 1400–1200 BC):**

| Direction | Power | Significance |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| East | Mesopotamia | "Outstanding pioneer in literate culture and international trade" |
| South | Egypt | "The aristocrat of the international Order" |
| North | Hittite Empire | Leading power after defeating Mitannians |
| West | Sea People | Mycenaean Greeks emerging as dominant factor |

**Canaan's position**: Ugarit was near the northwest corner of Canaan, "the land that nurtured a number of linguistically related groups, including the Phoenicians and Hebrews."

**Key quote**: "Ugarit was in contact with the forerunners of the classical Greeks and Hebrews, who were destined to found Western civilization by their combined and parallel achievements."

### 3. The Amarna Age International Order

**Definition**: The period (late 15th–early 14th century BC) when "the entire Near East form[ed] an Order centered on the East Mediterranean."

**Evidence**: The Tell el-Amarna tablets (found 1887–1933) contain Babylonian letters exchanged between Pharaohs and monarchs of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Canaan, and Cyprus.

**Key insight**: "The ancestors of the classical Hebrews and Greeks were then on the scene in the Levant. The Ugaritic texts therefore give us the backdrop to the earliest Greek and Hebrew literatures."

### 4. The Alphabet Sequence

**Thesis**: The Ugaritic alphabet embodies the same tradition that came down through Phoenicians/Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans.

**Evidence**: Ugaritic school texts list letters in fixed order: *a b g h d h w z h t y k š l m d n z s° p s q r t ġ t i u ṣ*

**Comparison:**
- English ABC: *a b—d—h—k l m n—p q r—t* appears in same Ugaritic sequence
- Hebrew: *a b g d h w z h t y k l m n s° p s q r—t* agrees even more strikingly

**Key quote**: "This alphabet is the most important and useful single invention of civilized man. Greece and Israel shared it—and much else besides."

### 5. Polyglot Vocabularies and Sophisticated Literacy

**Evidence**: School tablets list words in three or four parallel columns:
- Three-column: Sumerian, Akkadian, Hurrian
- Four-column: adds Ugaritic

**Implication**: "A community that fostered a school system in which the advanced scribes studied texts to qualify them in four languages at a time, was highly sophisticated."

**Key quote**: "The earliest Greek and Hebrew literatures stem from a highly cultured and international milieu. There is nothing primitive about either of them."

### 6. Against Separating Greece from the Semitic World

**Thesis**: The tacit assumption that Israel and Greece were "independent cultures, poles apart" is contradicted by the Ugaritic epics.

**The Athens-Sparta analogy**:
- "It would be hard to imagine two cultures more different than those of Athens and Sparta in the Age of Pericles, and yet because they were both Greek we know that they were related."
- "The newspapers in the homes of the English village and in the apartments of Manhattan are better historical and cultural criteria than the buildings."

**Against scholarly resistance**: Gordon explicitly challenges "some writers who want to keep Minoan civilization free of Asiatic—and particularly Semitic—'contamination.'"

**Key quote**: "What is often misunderstood is that relationship and individuality are not mutually exclusive."

### 7. The Shift from Prehistory to History

**Thesis**: The decipherment of Linear A moves Minoan studies from prehistory to history.

**Key quote**: "There are veteran Minoan scholars who have not really come to grips with the fact that with the decipherment of Linear A, their field has emerged from prehistory into history."

## Notable Passages

> "Ugarit was the heir of the great cultures that had gone before, from Sumer to Egypt. Ugarit had the closest relations with people such as the Hittites and Hurrians, who were of prime importance in Mycenaean times, but were destined to disappear and require the spade of the archaeologist to revive their memory."

— *Context*: Establishing Ugarit's position as inheritor and transmitter of ancient traditions.

> "We need not and must not withhold credit from the Ugaritians themselves. They were a talented and enterprising people in their own right. But they were lucky to be living in the right place at the right time: at the crossroads of the Western world when the seeds of Hellas and Israel had been planted and were producing their first fruits."

— *Context*: Balancing Ugarit's derivative and original contributions.

> "A tacit assumption has it that Israel and Greece were independent cultures, poles apart. Speciously, a case can be made for such a view. For when did Israel produce a Parthenon, and when did Greece bring forth an Isaiah? But the Ugaritic epics, as will appear below, have unmistakable and organic parallels that link the preprophetic Hebrews with the prephilosophical Greeks."

— *Context*: The central thesis of the book, challenging disciplinary separation.
