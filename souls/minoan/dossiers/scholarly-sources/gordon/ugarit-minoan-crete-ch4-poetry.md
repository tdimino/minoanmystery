## Overview

This massive chapter (100+ pages) contains Gordon's complete translations of the major Ugaritic mythological and epic texts. It includes the Baal and Anath Cycle (Yamm's kingship, Baal's palace building, the Baal-Mot conflict), the Epic of Kret (with its Helen-of-Troy motif), and the Epic of Aqhat/Danel (with parallels to Genesis and David's lament). Gordon provides extensive commentary linking these texts to both Greek and Hebrew literature.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter contains the primary source translations for all the literary parallels discussed elsewhere—Kothar-wa-Hasis building Baal's palace, the Kret/Hurrai Helen-of-Troy motif, Danel's curse paralleling David, and the Leviathan/Tannin mythology.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Myth vs Epic: Definitions

**Myth**: "A narrative aimed at explaining either a natural phenomenon, such as some basic aspect of fertility (e.g., rain or dew), or a general condition affecting man's welfare (e.g., peace, health, or prosperity)."
- Used ritually to induce well-being by sympathetic principles
- Ritual drama reenacts myth

**Epic**: "Heroic narratives about people, although the gods are constantly affecting their destiny."
- Heroes are of the ruling class
- Continuity of royal line is of prime interest
- "The people worthy of a place in the epic are greater than life-size. As such they mingle with the gods socially."
- May have historical kernel; myths usually lack one

### 2. Ugaritic Prosody

**Structure**: Parallelistic balance—"two or more units of expression repeat, oppose, or otherwise complement each other."

**Synonymous pairs**: If "Baal" appears in one hemistich, the poet uses "Hadd" or "Dagon's Son" or "the Rider of Clouds" in the parallel.

**Repetitions**: Gordon notes that "repetitions (with varying differences in wording) are part and parcel of the literary style; in general they do not result from the combining of different sources"—a challenge to documentary hypothesis assumptions.

**Challenge to Source Criticism**: This observation has significant implications for biblical studies. The Wellhausen school's documentary hypothesis identified repetitions as evidence of multiple sources being conflated. Gordon argues instead that repetition is an *aesthetic* feature of Northwest Semitic literature, not evidence of composite authorship. The same repetitive patterns appear in both Ugaritic texts (where no source conflation is proposed) and biblical texts (where it has been assumed).

### 3. The Baal and Anath Cycle

#### a. Yamm's Kingship (Text 129)

Yamm (Sea) wins kingship and has a palace built by Kothar-wa-Hasis. This establishes the sequence: Yamm's palace precedes Baal's.

**Key passage**:
> "Build the house of Prince Sea / Erect the palace of Judge River"

#### b. Baal vs Yamm (Text 137)

Yamm demands that El hand over Baal. Despite Baal's fury, El surrenders him:
> "Baal is thy slave, O Sea! / Baal is thy slave, O Sea! / Dagon's Son is thy captive!"

**The magic clubs**: Kothar-wa-Hasis fashions two war clubs—*Aymr* ("Driver") stuns the foe, *Ygrš* ("Expeller") vanquishes him.

#### c. Anath's Slaughter and Boasts

Anath's boasts include defeating Leviathan:
> "I crushed the crooked serpent / The mighty one of seven heads."

**Biblical parallel**: Psalm 74:14 attributes victory over many-headed Leviathan to Yahweh with verbally identical terminology.

#### d. Baal's Palace Building (Text 51)

Baal, having defeated Yamm, needs a palace. Kothar-wa-Hasis is summoned from Caphtor to build it:
- Materials: gold, silver, lapis lazuli, cedars of Lebanon
- Controversy over including a window (through which Mot later enters)

**Key passage** (Anath's demand to El):
> "Baal has no house like the gods / Nor a court like the sons of Asherah"

### 4. The Epic of Kret

**Plot**: King Kret's destined wife Hurrai has departed. He must retrieve her from King Pbl's court in Udum—the Helen-of-Troy motif.

**Kret's vow to Asherah:**
> "As Asherah of the Tyrians lives / Even the Goddess of the Sidonians! / If I may take Hurrai to my house / Yea cause the girl to enter my court / I'll give twice her (price) in silver / Even thrice her (price) in gold!"

**Hurrai's description:**
> "Give me Lady Hurrai / The fairest of thy firstborn's family / Whose charm is like Anath's charm / Whose loveliness is like Astarte's loveliness"

**Biblical connections:**
- Name *Krt* = brook in I Kings 17:3, 5
- Eponymous ancestor in Zephaniah 2:6
- Appears in Hagia Triada tablets

### 5. The Epic of Aqhat/Danel

**Plot**: Danel, a virtuous ruler, seeks a model son. After proper rites (incubation, sacrifices), he sires Aqhat. Aqhat is murdered after refusing to sell his wondrous bow to Anath. His sister Pughat avenges him.

**Danel's Curse:**
> "Seven years may Baal afflict thee / Eight, the Rider of Clouds! / Let there be no dew / Let there be no rain / Let there be no surging of the Two Deeps / Let there be no goodness of Baal's voice!"

**David's Lament (II Samuel 1:21):**
> "O mountains of Gilboa / Let there be no rain / Let there be no dew upon you!"

**Key quote**: "Danel and David react in the same way and express themselves in almost identical words because the culture and literature of heroic Israel stemmed from the heritage of Canaan."

**Biblical echoes:**
- Qehat (Kohath), son of Levi = variant of Aqhat
- Ezekiel 14:14 mentions Danel with Noah and Job as virtuous men of old
- Pughat's transvestism → Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibition

— *Context*: Defining the epic genre and its characteristic mingling of human and divine.

> "I crushed the crooked serpent / The mighty one of seven heads."

— *Context*: Anath's boast, verbally identical to biblical descriptions of Leviathan in Isaiah 27:1 and Psalm 74:14.

> "Repetitions (with varying differences in wording) are part and parcel of the literary style; in general they do not result from the combining of different sources."

— *Context*: Gordon's challenge to documentary hypothesis assumptions about biblical repetitions.
