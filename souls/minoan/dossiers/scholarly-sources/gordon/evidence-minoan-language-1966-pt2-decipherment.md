# Evidence for the Minoan Language (1966) — Part 2: Linear A Decipherment

## Source

- **Type**: Monograph (Chapters VIII–XIII)
- **Full Title**: *Evidence for the Minoan Language*
- **Author**: Cyrus H. Gordon
- **Publisher**: Ventnor Publishers, Ventnor, N.J.
- **Date**: 10 February 1966
- **Pages**: 26–39 (this section)

## Overview

This central section presents Gordon's methodology for deciphering Linear A through virtual bilinguals, contextual analysis, and comparison with the Eteocretan evidence. Building on Ventris's Linear B values (since most Linear A signs recur in Linear B), Gordon establishes that Minoan is Northwest Semitic through systematic vocabulary analysis. The section culminates in comprehensive word lists proving the Semitic character of Minoan.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This is the technical core—the actual decipherment work. The vocabulary tables (§113, §126) provide the linguistic evidence that Minoan Crete spoke a language ancestral to Phoenician.

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Ventris Foundation (§114)

Gordon accepts Ventris's 1952 Linear B decipherment as the basis for pronouncing Linear A:

> "The decipherment of Mycenaean Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952 was confirmed by a 'virtual bilingual' from Pylos in which various pots are drawn pictographically as well as defined syllabically in Mycenaean Greek... Since most of the Linear A signs recur in Linear B with the same phonetic values, Ventris's decipherment enables us to pronounce many names and words in the Minoan Linear A texts." (§114)

**Proof of sign continuity**: The same proper names appear in both scripts (e.g., *pa-i-to* "Phaistos"), implying identical phonetic values.

### 2. Virtual Bilinguals in Linear A (§115–116)

#### The Pot-Name Tablet (HT 31)

Like the Pylos tablet that confirmed Linear B, Hagia Triada tablet HT 31 shows pictographs of pots with their Minoan names spelled syllabically.

**Four of five legible pot names are Semitic** (§115):

| Minoan | Semitic | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| *qa-pa* | Hebrew כַּף *kap* | "pan, vessel" |
| *su-pu* | Hebrew/Ugaritic סַף *sap* | "jar" |
| *ka-ro-pa* | Akkadian *karpu* (cf. Ug. *krpn*) | "vase" |
| *su-pa-ra* | Hebrew/Ugaritic סֶפֶל *sefel* | "pot" |

#### The Wheat Equation (§116)

> "The WHEAT determinative following *ku-ni-su* tells us that the word means 'wheat.' In Akkadian *ku(n)nisu* means 'emmer wheat.' Its Aramaic cognate כֻּנָּתָא (a masculine noun from the Semitic root *\*knt*) is defined as 'spelt' wheat."

The parallel: Linear B *si-to* + WHEAT = σῖτος "wheat"

**Result**: Minoan *ku-ni-su* = Mycenaean *si-to* — a Greco-Semitic equation via the WHEAT determinative.

### 3. Contextual Evidence (§117–123)

#### "All, Total" — *ku-ro* (§117–118)

Totals on Minoan tablets are labeled *ku-ro* = Semitic *kull-* (Hebrew כֹּל *kōl*) "all."

**Example** — HT 88 (§117):
```
ki-ro ku-pa-nu    1
ka-x              1
ku-pa-nu          1
pa-ya-re          1
sa-ma-ro          1
da-ta-re          1
—————————————————
ku-ro             6
```

**"Grandtotal"**: HT 122 uses *po-to-ku-ro* = בַּת כֹּל "daughter of all" = "grandtotal" (§118)

#### Magic Bowls (§119)

A magic bowl from Knossos (II,2) opens with *a-ka-nu* = Hebrew/Aramaic אַגָּן *'aggān* "bowl"—the same term used for magic bowls in Aramaic incantations.

#### Dedicatory Formulae (§120–123)

**The *ya-ta-no* formula** (§121):

Several stone cult objects begin with *ya-ta-no-* (var. *a-ta-no-*) = Phoenician יָתַן *yātan-* "he has given/donated."

A libation bowl (I,14) contains:
> *ya-ta-no-x u ya-[* ] = Phoenician יתן ויתנא *ytn wytn'* "he has given and set up as a votive offering"

Note: The conjunction "and" appears as *u* (as in Punic, Akkadian).

**The *ta-nu-a-ti* formula** (§122):

A libation table from Knossos (I,8) contains:
> *ta-nu-a-ti ya-sa-sa-ra-ma-na* = "I have set up this votive offering"

The verb תנא *tn'* "to set up (as a votive offering)" is common in Phoenician dedications.

**Wine on wine jars** (§123):

Pithoi from Knossos bear the word *ya-ne* flanked by word dividers = Hebrew יַיִן *yayin* "wine"—found on vessels with the WINE determinative.

### 4. The Minoan-Eteocretan Link (§124)

Gordon's key continuity proof:

> "An inscribed libation table from Palaikastro (I,4:b) refers to itself as *pi-te za* (with a word divider on each side) = Phoenician זה פתח 'this engraved monument.'"

**The chain**:
- Bronze Age Minoan: *pi-te* + *za*
- Hellenistic Eteocretan: ΕΙΤΙΘΙ + Ζ (Psychro text)
- Both = Phoenician פתח + ז

> "The Psychro text thus shows the continuity of the language and tradition since Minoan times." (§49, referenced in §124)

### 5. The Dictaean Table (§125)

Libation table I,3 from the Dictaean Cave contains:

> *ki-te-te-bi k[i]-re-[ya]-tu* = כי תיטב קריה "so that the city may thrive"

The word *ki-re-ya-tu* = קִרְיָה *qiryāh* "city" (Hebrew, Ugaritic *qryt*) is "virtually certain."

### 6. Established Minoan Vocabulary (§126)

> "The nature and variety of the Semitic vocabulary of the Linear A texts indicate that Minoan is Northwest Semitic, and is basically the parent language of Eteocretan."

**Core vocabulary table**:

| Minoan | Semitic | Hebrew/Phoenician | Meaning |
|--------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| *u* | ו | ו | "and" |
| *re* | ל | ל | "to, for" |
| *za* | ז | ז | "this" |
| *ya-ta-n(o-)* | יתן | יָתַן | "he gave" |
| *ta-nu-a-ti* | תנאת | תנאת | "I set up" |
| *ki-re-ya-tu* | קרית | קִרְיָה | "city" |
| *ku-ni-su* | כנשׁ | ku(n)nišu | "wheat" |
| *pi-te* | פתח | פֵּתַח | "engraved monument" |
| *ya-ne* | יין | יַיִן | "wine" |
| *ku-ro* | כל | כֹּל | "all, total" |
| *a-ka-nu* | אגן | אַגָּן | "cup, bowl" |
| *su-pu* | סף | סַף | "jar" |
| *qa-pa* | כף | כַּף | "pan, vessel" |
| *ka-ro-pa* | כרפ | *karpu* | "vase" |
| *su-pa-ra* | ספל | סֶפֶל | "pot" |

| *da-ku-se-ne* | *Daku-šenni* | Attested at Nuzi and Ugarit |

### Northwest Semitic Divine Names (§129–131)

| Minoan | Semitic | Identity |
|--------|---------|----------|
| *a-du* | אדד *Haddu/Addu* | Another name of Baal; most frequently mentioned god at HT |
| *ti-ni-ta* | תנית *Tīnīt* | Phoenician goddess Tinit |
| *ya-mu* | ים *Yammu* | Northwest Semitic sea-god |

### The Name "David" (§133)

> "*Da-we-da* is דוד 'David,' and *pa-de* is the name borne by the Philistine king of Ekron, Padi, which appears at Ugarit as *pd* and *pdy*."

*Da-we-da* appears **four times** in Minoan texts (see §163 index).

## Chapters X–XII: Minoan Orthography, Phonetics, Morphology (§138–162)

### Orthographic Rules (§138–146)

| Sign Series | Covers | Examples |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| p-signs | *b* and *p* | *su-pu* (*sp*), *te-te-pi* (*yṭb*) |
| t-signs | *t* and *ṭ* | *ya-ta-no* (*ytn*), *ma-ka-we-te* (*mqwṭ*) |
| d-signs | *d* and *ḏ* | *da-we-da* (דוד), *da-ku-na* (דגן) |
| k-signs | *k*, *g*, *q* | *ku-ro* (*kl*), *ku-pa-nu* (*gpn*), *ki-re-ya-tu* (*qryt*) |
| r-signs | *r* and *l* | *ki-re-ya-tu* (*qiryatu*), *ku-ro* (*kull*) |
| s-signs | *s*, *š*, *ṯ* | *su-pu* (*sp*), *ya-sa-sa-ra-mu* (*yšslm*), *ku-ni-su* (*knt*) |

**Length not indicated**: *a-ka-nu* = *'aggān*, *ku-ro* = *kull-*, *ya-mu* = *yammu*

**Diphthongs**: *ay* is omitted in *ya-ne* (pronounced *yayn-* = יין); *aw* written as *u* in *ka-u-do-ni*

### Phonetic Features (§147–150)

**The ʿayin > o shift** (§150):
> "The ʿ (cayin) at least in certain combinations, shifts to *o*. Thus *ʿa > o* in: *baʿl- > bōl-* (written *pu-ra*) 'Baal' and *naʿl- > nōl-* 'sandal.'"

This explains why the SANDALED FOOT sign has value *no* (from *nōl* < *naʿl*).

### Morphological Features (§151–162)

| Feature | Minoan | Semitic Parallel |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Nominative -u | *ku-ni-su*, *ki-re-ya-tu*, *a-du* | Triptotic noun system |
| Feminine -atu | *ku-pa-na-tu* (vs. m. *ku-pa-nu*) | Standard Semitic f. sg. |
| Feminine -ti | *da-ku-se-ne-ti*, *pa-da-su-ti* | Feminizes names |
| Relative *dū* | *du ra-re* "that of the night-demon" | Arabic *ḏū*, Aramaic *dī* |
| Verb + suffix | *ya-ta-no-x* "he gave it" | Object suffix |
| Causative *yaš-* | *ya-sa-sa-ra-mu* | Shafel (as in Ugaritic) |
| Preposition *re* | *re ya-sa-[sa-ra-m?]* "as a votive offering" | Arabic *li* (vs. Hebrew *la*) |
| Conjunction *u* | *ya-ta-no-x u ya-[* ]* | Punic, Akkadian form |

## Notable Passages

> "The problem of deciphering Minoan thus resolves itself into fixing by context the meanings of pronounceable Minoan words and phrases to establish the identity of the language, which can be done if Minoan belongs to a known linguistic family." (§114)

> "Northwest Semitic is the only possible classification of a language that goes with Hebrew-Phoenician-Ugaritic in expressing 'the, this, his, for, and, all, it will be, he gave, I gave, mother, people, friend, companion, city,' three numerals, a variety of nouns for common objects and commodities in daily life, etc." (Foreword)

> "The decipherment is validated by the established results; it is in no way shaken by inconclusive or even mistaken details beyond those established results." (Foreword)
