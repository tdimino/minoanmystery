## Overview

This chapter surveys the administrative and historical documents from Ugarit, establishing the dynastic history from Niqmad I (ca. 19th century BC) through Ammurapi (ending ca. 1195 BC with the Sea People invasion)—a span of over 600 years. Gordon examines royal correspondence, land grants, guild organization, and merchant regulations. Most significantly for the Minoan-Semitic thesis, he identifies personal names in PRU V that link Ugarit to both the Aegean (Mn "Minos," Ddl "Daedalus") and early Israel (Yšril "Israel," Abrm "Abram," Mt "Moses").

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the documentary evidence for cultural connections—personal names demonstrating that the same onomastic traditions existed at Ugarit, in the Aegean, and in Israel. It also illuminates Bronze Age guild society, the social context in which craftsmen like Kothar-wa-Hasis operated.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Six-Hundred-Year Dynasty

**Thesis**: Ugarit's royal line endured from the 19th century BC until ca. 1195 BC—longer than the Judean House of David (ca. 1000–586 BC).

**Dynastic sequence (documented period):**

| King | Approximate Dates | Key Events |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Ammistamru I | Amarna Age | Loyal to Egypt (Amarna Letter 45) |
| Niqmad II | until ca. 1345 BC | Fire and rebuilding; shift to Hittite vassalage |
| Arhalba | ca. 1345–1336 BC | Childless; levirate marriage arrangement |
| Niqmepa | ca. 1336–1265 BC | Long prosperous reign; merchant regulations |
| Ammistamru II | after ca. 1265 BC | Material prosperity; troubled marriages |
| Ibiranu | after Ammistamru II | Reprimanded for neglecting Hittite obligations |
| Niqmad III | short reign | — |
| Ammurapi | until ca. 1195 BC | Last king; Sea People invasion ends dynasty |

**Key quote**: "The dynasty endured from the nineteenth century B.C., when Yaqarum's seal was probably carved, until the beginning of the twelfth century, when the Ugaritic kingdom came to an end: a span of over six hundred years."

### 2. The Merchants from Ur(ra)

**Thesis**: Hattusilis III's regulations for merchants from Ur(ra) at Ugarit illuminate the status of foreign merchants—and parallel the Patriarchal narratives.

**The three regulations for merchants of Ur(ra):**
1. May ply their trade and collect debts
2. May NOT stay permanently (must leave after harvest)
3. May NOT acquire real estate

**Parallel to Genesis**: In Genesis 34:10, 21, the Shechemites offer Jacob's family precisely these three normally forbidden privileges—trading rights, permanent residence, and purchasing real estate.

**The Significance for Abraham's Status**: Gordon notes that Abraham's narrative makes sense within this framework—he is precisely the kind of foreign merchant (from Ur) whose status required special regulations. The offer of these privileges represents a formal elevation of status, not merely hospitality.

**Key quote**: "It is interesting to note that these merchants came from Ur(a), a city bearing the same name as the city where Abraham was born."

**Additional Note**: The seasonal restriction (leaving after harvest) explains the transhumant patterns in the Patriarchal narratives—the constant movement between regions reflects the legal status of foreign merchants who could not establish permanent residence without special privilege.

### 3. Royal Power: To Give and Take Back

**Thesis**: The king's arbitrary power to revoke land grants illuminates biblical and Homeric parallels.

**Evidence**: Administrative documents show the king could dispose of real estate at will—taking land from some subjects and giving it to others.

**Literary parallels:**
- **Iliad 1:299**: Achilles resents but does not contest Agamemnon's taking back his prize
- **Job 1:21**: "Yahweh has given and Yahweh has taken away"—attributing to God the conventional right of kings

**Key quote**: "When Job says (1:21) 'Yahweh has given and Yahweh has taken away, blessed be the name of Yahweh,' he is attributing to God the conventional right of kings: to take back what they have given."

### 4. Guild Society

**Thesis**: Ugaritic society was organized by hereditary guilds, providing the social framework for craft transmission.

**Guild types documented**:
- Builders, smiths, potters
- "Countless types of craftsmen"
- Military guilds
- Priestly guilds

**Key insight**: "The ruling class infiltrated the military and religious guilds, thus cementing its hold on the nation."

### 5. Personal Names: Aegean and Hebrew Links

**Thesis**: Personal names in PRU V confirm Ugarit's connections with both the Aegean and Israel.

**Aegean names:**
| Ugaritic | Greek Equivalent |
|----------|------------------|
| *Mn* | Mino-s |
| *Ddl* | Daedal-us |

**Hebrew names:**
| Ugaritic | Hebrew Equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|
| *Yšril* | Israel |
| *Abrm* | Ab(i)ram |
| *Mt* | Moses |
| *Išbᶜl* | Eshbaal |

**Key quote**: "PRU V confronts us with personal names such as Mn, 'Mino-s,' and Ddl, 'Daedal-us,' recalling the names of the two leading figures in Minoan civilization."

## Notable Passages

> "No future history of early Greece or Israel (to say nothing of the ancient Near East as a whole) can afford to neglect the rich and important documentation of Ugarit."

— *Context*: The concluding statement of the chapter, asserting Ugarit's central importance for both Greek and Hebrew historiography.

> "The Hittites did not cut off Ugarit from any part of the world, not even Egypt. It was in everyone's interest to maintain trade and prosperity, so that Ugarit, though militarily a vassal state within the Hittite system, was permitted to run its own internal affairs and to carry on its trade with the rest of the world."

— *Context*: Explaining how Ugarit maintained its cosmopolitan character despite political subjugation—the economic foundation for cultural exchange.

> "In his material prosperity and his trouble with women he is somewhat reminiscent of Solomon."

— *Context*: Comparing Ammistamru II to Solomon—both wealthy kings with marriage difficulties, suggesting shared cultural patterns.
