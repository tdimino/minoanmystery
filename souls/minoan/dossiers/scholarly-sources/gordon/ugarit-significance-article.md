## Overview

This late article (1974) synthesizes Gordon's mature views on Ugarit's significance for Western civilization. He covers the Kothar-wa-Hasis/Caphtor connection, Sapyselaton evidence for Ugaritic divine names in Greece, the shared alphabet tradition, extensive Ugaritic-Hebrew parallel word pairs, the prepositions *b* and *l* meaning "from," Biblical reactions against Canaanite practices (coveting, bestiality, transvestism, honey offerings), Abraham as a royal merchant from Ur(ra), and the Helen-of-Troy motif in Homer, Ugarit, and Genesis.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This is Gordon's most comprehensive single article, bringing together the Kothar-wa-Hasis connection, the linguistic evidence, the epic parallels, and the cultural context in one accessible synthesis.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Kothar-wa-Hasis and Crete

**Thesis**: Ugarit's mythology confirms that Crete was the center of material culture for the Northwest Semitic sphere.

**Evidence:**
- *Kothar-wa-Hasis* is the god of arts, crafts, and architecture with his "atelier on Caphtor"
- His name is "pure Semitic" in all its elements
- An Akkadian tablet records a ship trading between Ugarit and Caphtor (Crete)

**Key quote**: "This is the way mythology states that Ugarit looked to Crete as the centre of its material culture. At that time the greatest artistic centre in the East Mediterranean was Crete."

### 2. Sapyselaton and Ugaritic Divine Names in Greece

**Thesis**: West Semitic divine names reached Greece, proved by the place name Sapyselaton.

**Evidence:**
- Pausanius (2:25:10) records that a site near Epidaurus was called *Sapyselatôn*
- This reflects distinctively Ugaritic *špš elt* "the goddess Špš"
- The labial stop *-p-* (not *-m-*) and feminine gender link it to Ugaritic

**Citation**: Michael Astour, *Hellenosemitica* (1965), p. 103, n.1

### 3. Minoan-Eteocretan Linguistic Continuity

**Thesis**: Eteocretan is West Semitic with Aramaic affinities, and shares words with Minoan.

**Evidence:**
- Eteocretan written at Praisos, Dreros, Psychro (600–300 BC)
- Words common to both: *kl* "all," *u* "and"
- Proposed continuity of dedication formulas from Minoan to Eteocretan

**Key quote**: "What is clear is that the non-Greek 'Eteocretan' language written at Cretan sites such as Praisos, Dreros and Psychro between 600 and 300 B.C. is West Semitic with strong Aramaic affinities."

### 4. The Alphabet Order

**Thesis**: The Ugaritic ABC preserves the order inherited by Phoenician-Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets.

**Evidence:**
- Ugaritic has 30 letters; the 22 that constitute Phoenician-Hebrew are already in the same sequence
- The letter *u* after *t* is preserved in Ugaritic, Greek, and Latin but lost in Phoenician-Hebrew
- Shorter Ugaritic alphabet (right-to-left, like Hebrew) found at Sarepta, Mount Tabor, Taanach, Beth-Shemesh

**Key quote**: "The most basic level of continuity from Ugarit to all subsequent stages of Western Civilization is brought out by the order of the alphabetic letters used at Ugarit."

### 5. Parallel Word Pairs

**Thesis**: Ugaritic and Hebrew share not just individual words but conventionally paired synonyms used in parallel stichs.

**Examples:**

| Word 1 | Word 2 | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| *'hlym* | *mšknwt* | "tents" ∥ "tabernacles" |
| *'yb* | *gr* | "enemy" ∥ "foe" |
| *'lp* | *rbbh* | "1000" ∥ "10,000" |
| *ksp* | *hrws* | "silver" ∥ "gold" |
| *yd'* | *byn* | "know" ∥ "perceive" |
| *'wlm* | *dr dr* | "eternity" ∥ "everlastingness" |

**Two-word phrase pair:**
- *tl (h)šmym* ∥ *šmny (h)'rs* = "dew of (the) heavens" ∥ "fat of (the) earth"

### 6. The Psalm 92/Ugaritic Text 68 Parallel

**Thesis**: Identical poetic structures with same vocabulary appear in Ugaritic and Hebrew.

**Ugaritic text 68:8-9:**
> *ht·ibk bllm* "now, thine enemies, O Baal,
> *ht·ibkt mhṣ* now thine enemies shalt thou smite,
> *ht·tsmt srik* now shalt thou destroy thy foes"

**Psalm 92:10:**
> *ky hnh'ybyk yhwh* "for lo thine enemies, O Yahweh,
> *ky-hnh'ybyk y'bdw* for lo thine enemies shall perish,
> *ytprdw kl-p'ly 'wn* all doers of iniquity will be scattered"

**Structural identity**: Divine name placement, repeated noun for "foes," synonym in final stich.

### 7. Prepositions *b* and *l* Meaning "from"

**Thesis**: Ugaritic clarifies Hebrew passages where *b* and *l* mean "from" (not "in/to").

**Key example** (2 Kings 14:28):
- Text: Jeroboam II restored Damascus and Hamath *lyhwdh* "from Judah" into Israel
- Problem: How could northern Israel restore areas to southern Judah?
- Solution: "Judah" here = Sam'al (Zinjirli) in northern Syria, not Jerusalem
- Ugaritic proves *l* = "from" in this context

**Key quote**: "For two and a half millennia the readers of the biblical books of Kings, with their Jerusalemite Judean orientation, did not understand the passage."

### 8. Biblical Reactions to Canaanite Practices

**Thesis**: Key biblical prohibitions consciously oppose Canaanite religious practices recorded at Ugarit.

| Biblical Prohibition | Ugaritic Background |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bestiality (Lev 18:23) | Baal mates with heifer, sires bull calf |
| Golden Calf | Variation of bull cult in Baal Cycle |
| Transvestism (Deut 22:5) | Pughat wears man's garb and sword to avenge Aqhat |
| Coveting (10th Commandment) | Baal described as *hmd* "coveting" god (texts 75, 2001) |
| Honey offerings (Lev 2:11) | Honey specified as offering in Epic of Kret:165 |

**Ahab and Jezebel:**
- Ahab adhered to Hebrew values (Tenth Commandment)
- Jezebel followed Canaanite *imitatio deorum*—did what Anath did (murdered Naboth for property)
- "The tragedy... was not that a good man had the misfortune to be wed to a bad woman, but rather that husband and wife adhered to opposing value systems."

### 9. Abraham as Royal Merchant from Ur(ra)

**Thesis**: The Patriarchs were royal merchants operating from Ur(ra), illuminated by Hattusilis III's regulations.

**Hattusilis III's tablet to Niqmepa' (ca. 1336–1265 BC):**
Three regulations for merchants of Ur(ra) in Ugarit:
1. May ply their trade and collect debts
2. May NOT stay permanently (must leave after harvest)
3. May NOT acquire real estate

**Genesis 34:10, 21**: Shechemites offer Jacob's family precisely these three normally forbidden privileges:
1. Trading rights
2. Permanent residence
3. Purchasing real estate

**Abraham buying land** (Genesis 23): Stressed precisely because foreigners were not ordinarily allowed to acquire it.

**Ur(ra) = Urfa**: Syriac *Orrhai* close to Akkadian *Ur-ra*; suitable location in Hattusilis's realm; connected to Aramaism (matching Patriarchal language and homeland).

### 10. The Helen-of-Troy Motif

**Thesis**: Royal epic in Homer, Ugarit, and Genesis all contain the motif of retrieving a beautiful bride from a foreign court.

| Epic | King | Wife | Foreign Court |
|------|------|------|---------------|
| Iliad | Menelaus | Helen | Priam's Troy |
| Kret | Kret | Hurrai | Pbl's Udum |
| Genesis 12 | Abraham | Sarah | Pharaoh's Egypt |
| Genesis 20 | Abraham | Sarah | Abimelech's Gerar |

**Key quote**: "All three sets of texts deal with royal epic. Moreover all three have built into them what we may call the Helen of Troy motif."

## Notable Passages

> "Kothar-wa-Hasis is a compound name, all of whose elements are Semitic. We know of specific ties between Ugarit and the Aegean sphere that became Greek."

— *Context*: Establishing the Semitic identity of the craftsman god whose workshop was on Crete.

> "The late Professor Cassuto felicitously described the Hebrew Bible as new wine in old bottles. The language and literary devices were old; Israel adopted them after the Conquest and during the Settlement, and proceeded to use them as the medium for expressing the new messages of the Bible."

— *Context*: The relationship between Canaanite literary forms and Israelite content.

> "That Ugarit has radically changed the nature of Old Testament studies is generally recognized. That it sheds important light on the Mycenaean Greeks and therefore on the earliest cultural history of Europe is becoming increasingly evident."

— *Context*: The concluding statement, asserting Ugarit's dual significance for both biblical and Greek studies.
