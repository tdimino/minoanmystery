## Overview

This chapter establishes the cultural mechanisms by which Ugaritic literature connects Greek and Hebrew traditions. Gordon demonstrates how guild mobility (craftsmen, traders, priests) spread cultural complexes across the East Mediterranean, then traces specific parallels: the Baal-Mot cycle's sabbatical structure, Kothar-wa-Hasis coming from Caphtor to build Baal's palace, the Helen-of-Troy motif linking Homer's Iliad to the Epic of Kret to Genesis, and the shared vocabulary of Danel's curse and David's lament over Gilboa.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter explicitly places Kothar-wa-Hasis as the link between Crete and Ugarit, shows how the Helen-of-Troy motif bridges Greek and Hebrew epic, and provides the cultural context for understanding Minoan-Semitic connections.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Guild Mobility and Cultural Transmission

**Thesis**: The international spread of cultural patterns in the Bronze Age East Mediterranean resulted from the mobility of guildsmen—craftsmen, potters, warriors, traders, and priests.

**Evidence:**
- "There was no point in importing fragile ceramics for ordinary household use. It was the potters, rather than their wares, who could move without breakage."
- Warriors organized into guilds (like the *maryannu* charioteers) served on both sides of conflicts
- Ugaritic text 81 mentions mobile traders (*mkrm* = Hebrew *môkērîm*) and two priestly guilds: *khnm* (= Hebrew *kōhănîm*) and *qdšm* (= Hebrew *qĕdēšîm*)

### The Kōhănîm vs. Qĕdēšîm Distinction

Gordon's footnote 4 provides a crucial insight into how the Hebrews selectively adopted and rejected Canaanite religious institutions:

> "This illustrates the fact that the Hebrews sometimes **borrowed from** (as in the case of the *kōhănîm*), and at other times **reacted against** (as in the case of the *qĕdēšîm*), their Canaanite milieu."

- **Kōhănîm** (כֹּהֲנִים): The legitimate priestly guild, borrowed from Canaanite practice and retained throughout biblical history to the present day
- **Qĕdēšîm** (קְדֵשִׁים): Temple functionaries associated with Asherah's cult, eliminated by King Josiah around 621 BC (II Kings 23:7)

**Significance**: This demonstrates that Hebrew religion was not created *ex nihilo* but emerged through selective adoption and deliberate rejection of existing Canaanite institutions. The same Ugaritic text documenting both priestly guilds shows they operated side by side in Canaanite religion; Israel's choice to keep one and eliminate the other reveals the theological priorities of emerging Yahwism.

**Key quote**: "The international spread of religious guilds helped disseminate cultic practices and religious beliefs far and wide."

### 2. Sapyselaton: West Semitic Divine Names in Greece

**Thesis**: West Semitic divine names reached Greek soil, proved by the site name "Sapyselaton" near Epidauris.

**Analysis:**
- Pausanius (2:25:10) records the name "Sapyselaton"
- "Sapys" = Ugaritic *Spš*, the sun "goddess" (*elat*)
- The *p* (not *m*) and feminine gender link it to Ugaritic, not Akkadian
- This is distinctively Northwest Semitic: "unmistakably with the Ugaritic branch"

### 3. The Bull (*taur-*) Etymology

**Thesis**: The word for "bull" connecting El/Thôr to Greek/Latin *taur-* entered the Aegean through Semitic channels.

**Evidence:**
- El is called *Thôr* "the Bull" at Ugarit
- In Judges 6:25, God is mentioned as *ha-š-Šôr* "the Bull"
- Cognates: Arabic *thawr-*, Hebrew/Akkadian *šôr-*, Aramaic *tôr-*, Greek/Latin *taur-*
- "The role of the bull in religion and sport is strikingly similar in both the Semitic and Indo-European segments of Mediterranean civilization, especially in the Minoan-Mycenaean sphere."

### 4. El's Drama and the Sabbatical Cycle (Text 52)

**Thesis**: Text 52 shows the sabbatical cycle as a Canaanite institution predating Hebrew adoption.

**Content:**
- El sires progeny from two human wives
- First: Dawn (*Šaḥar*) and Dusk
- Later: Seven Good Gods of fertility (seven-year cycle of plenty)

**Significance:**
- "A milestone in the evolution of the drama"—equipped with stage directions
- "The sabbatical cycle of the Old Testament is a religious and agricultural institution taken over by the Hebrews from the older, native population of Canaan"
- Anticipates Hosea and Ezekiel (23:1ff) in the "God with two women" theme

### 5. Baal, Anath, and Leviathan

**Thesis**: The dualistic conflict between good and evil entered biblical tradition through Canaanite heritage.

**Key text**: Anath boasts of aiding Baal against "the monster of evil, Leviathan"

**Parallels:**
- Psalm 74:14 attributes victory over many-headed Leviathan to Yahweh
- Isaiah 27:1: "the evil serpent," "the crooked serpent," "Tannin"
- "The terminology... is verbally identical in Ugaritic and Hebrew. We are dealing with a specific borrowing, not with the reappearance of a universal theme."

### 6. Kothar-wa-Hasis and Baal's Palace

**Thesis**: Kothar-wa-Hasis coming from Caphtor (Crete) to build Baal's palace proves Crete was part of the Northwest Semitic sphere.

**The Palace:**
- Built of gold, silver, lapis lazuli
- Columns from cedars of Lebanon
- Architect: Kothar-wa-Hasis, who proposes including a window
- Through the window comes Mot (cf. Jeremiah 9:20-21)

**The Caphtor Connection:**
- "Kothar-and-Hasis is represented as coming to Baal from Caphtor (Crete); his name is pure Semitic."
- "All this can only mean that Crete was part of the same Northwest Semitic sphere as Ugarit, culturally, religiously, and linguistically."

**Solomon parallel**: "As Solomon (in the tenth century BC) turned to Phoenicia, so Ugarit (around the middle of the second millennium BC) looked to Crete, for the best art in the contemporary West Semitic sphere."

### 7. Dagon and the Philistines

**Thesis**: Dagon as fish-god of the sea-faring Philistines from Crete.

**Etymology**: *Dag-on* = *dāg* "fish" + suffix *-ôn*
- "An appropriate name for the god of a sea people such as the Philistines, who came from Crete"
- Name spelled *Da-gu-na* in Minoan tablets from Hagia Triada

### 8. The Virgin Birth Formula (Text 77)

**Thesis**: The Ugaritic moon cult text contains an annunciation formula anticipating Isaiah 7:14.

**Text**: "The virgin will give birth" and "lo the maid will bear a son"

**Context**: Wedding of moon god Yarih and goddess Nikkal, predicting fertile union

### 9. Yahweh as El's Son

**Thesis**: The form *Yw-il* in Ugaritic shows Yahweh as El's son before monotheistic synthesis.

**Key quote**: "By identifying a particular god (*Yaw-* or Yahweh) with the head of the pantheon (El), and equating him with the principle of godhood (*Elohim*), the Hebrews arrived at the monotheism that has taken root in Western civilization."

### 10. The Epic of Aqhat

**Thesis**: The Epic of Aqhat was known to the Hebrews and provides pre-Hebrew literary sources.

**Parallels:**
- Levi's son Qehat ("Kohath") = variant of Aqhat
- Ezekiel 14:14; 28:3 mentions Danel by name
- Incubation and sacrifice for obtaining a model son = Abraham/Isaac pattern
- *Kosharot* (songstresses/muses) appear in Psalm 68:7
- Pughat's transvestism = why Deuteronomy forbids cross-dressing

**Danel's Curse:**
> "Seven years may Baal afflict thee / Eight, the Rider of Clouds! / Let there be no dew / Let there be no rain / Let there be no surging of the Two Deeps / Let there be no goodness of Baal's voice!"

**The Seven/Eight Formula**: The "seven years / eight" pattern is not merely poetic parallelism but reflects the sabbatical agricultural cycle—seven years of cultivation followed by the eighth year of fallow. This formula appears throughout Ugaritic literature (see also Text 52) and demonstrates the pre-Hebrew, Canaanite origin of the biblical sabbatical institution. (cf. p. 93n)

**David's Lament (II Samuel 1:21):**
> "O mountains of Gilboa / Let there be no rain / Let there be no dew upon you!"

**Key quote**: "Danel and David react in the same way and express themselves in almost identical words because the culture and literature of heroic Israel stemmed from the heritage of Canaan."

### 11. The Helen-of-Troy Motif

**Thesis**: The Epic of Kret bridges the gap between royal epic in Homer and Genesis through the Helen-of-Troy motif.

**Pattern**: A king whose destined wife has departed must retrieve her from another king's palace.

| Epic | King | Wife | Retriever |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Kret | Kret | Hurrai | Kret |
| Iliad | Menelaus | Helen | Achaeans |
| Genesis 12 | Abraham | Sarah | Abraham (from Pharaoh) |
| Genesis 20 | Abraham | Sarah | Abraham (from Abimelech) |

**Key quote**: "Today an attempt would be made to hush up such a story; but in Mycenaean times, no East Mediterranean royal epic was complete without it."

**Kret in Bible:**
- Brook *Kret* in I Kings 17:3, 5
- Eponymous ancestor of Cretans/Philistines in Zephaniah 2:6
- Name occurs commonly in Hagia Triada tablets
