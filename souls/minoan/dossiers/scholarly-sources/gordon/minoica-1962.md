## Overview

This foundational article moves beyond the Hagia Triada tablets to analyze dedicatory formulas from cultic objects across eastern and central Crete. Gordon establishes that Linear A represents "West Semitic, of the Phoenician type" through analysis of vocabulary (*ki-re-ya-tu* "city," *ya-ne* "wine," *bi-ti za* "this house"), morphology (prefixed *t-* verbs, the particle *ki* "so that"), and syntax. He also identifies the conjunction *u* "and" as West Semitic rather than East Semitic, revising his earlier position on the Hagia Triada dialect.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This is Gordon's key methodological article establishing Linear A as specifically Phoenician-type West Semitic, providing the linguistic foundation for the Minoan-Semitic thesis that connects Crete to the Canaanite world from which Kothar-wa-Hasis originates.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Palaikastro Dedication (Text I,3)

**Thesis**: The dedicatory formula proves Semitic morphology and syntax, not just vocabulary.

**Reading:**
- *le ya-sa-[sa-ra-mu]* = "to the deity Y." (with preposition לְ)
- *ki-te-te-bi ki-re-ya-tu* = "so that the city may be well"
- *ki-re-ya-tu* = קִרְיָה (*qiryat-*) "city" (Hebrew/Ugaritic)
- *ki-* = כִּי "so that, because" particle

**Analysis**: Gordon identifies three West Semitic features in one inscription:
1. Preposition *le-* = לְ "to, for"
2. Particle *ki* = כִּי "so that"
3. Noun *qiryat-* = קִרְיָה "city"

**Key quote**: "The fact remains that any single one of these West Semitic features (לְ, 'to,' כִּי 'so that,' קִרְיָה, 'city') would suffice to indicate the West Semitic character of the Minoan texts."

### 2. Wine on the Knossos Pithos (Text II,3)

**Thesis**: The word *ya-ne* inscribed on a pithos fragment means "wine."

**Evidence:**
- Two-syllable word with word-dividers on either side
- Following Linear B orthographic rules, *yai-* would be written *ya-*
- Therefore *ya-ne* = *yain-* = יַיִן "wine"
- Context: label referring to pithos contents

### 3. "This House" at Palaikastro (Text I,4:b)

**Thesis**: The phrase *bi-ti za* means "this house" (i.e., the shrine).

**Reading**: *bi-ti za* = Phoenician בַּיִת זֶה "this house"

**Orthographic problem and solution**: If *ya-ne* "wine" uses *ya-* for diphthong *ai*, why does *bi-ti* "house" use *bi-*?

Gordon's answer: Hebrew shows the same variation:
- בַּיִת < **bait* (with diphthong preserved)
- חַיִּים *haiq-* (with different treatment)

Alternative: *bi-ti za* may represent "בּיתי זה" = "this house of mine" with regressive vocalic assimilation (*baitī* > *bittī* = *bītī*), as known from Ugaritic.

### 4. The Psychro Stone Connection

**Thesis**: "Eteocretan" is simply a late survival of Phoenician on Crete.

**Evidence**: The Psychro stone (ca. 300 BC) opens with EΠIΘI ZH (also rendered *i-bi-ti* in Minoan characters), possibly equivalent to Phoenician (הַ)בַּיִת "the house" with definite article.

**Key quote**: "The collocation of EΠIΘI ZH in the Psychro 'Eteocretan' text with Minoan Linear A *bi-ti za* hints at the possibility of the 'Eteocretan' language being simply a late survival of Phoenician on Crete."

### 5. The Conjunction *u* "and"

**Thesis**: Minoan uses *u* "and" rather than expected *wa*, requiring revision of the East Semitic hypothesis.

**Evidence:**
- Text I, 4:c: *a-[sa]-sa-ra-mu u-na-ru-ka-na* = "(Y)asasaramu and Nergal"
- HT 28:a:1-2: *a-ne-ya-ka u-mi-na-ne* = "A. and Minan"

**Significance**: Gordon had previously argued for East Semitic identity based on *u* (instead of *wa*). This article acknowledges *u* occurs in West Semitic Minoan, necessitating re-examination.

**Key quote**: "Since the use of *u* (instead of *wa*) was my main reason for maintaining an East Semitic identity of the Hagia Triada dialect, the whole Hagia Triada problem requires re-examination."

> ### Editorial Note: The *Yasharum* Hypothesis
>
> Gordon's identification of *ya-sa-sa-ra-mu* as a deity requires careful examination. He writes: "*Ya-sa-sa-ra-mu* is taken by all Minoanists to be a deity; whether that deity is female (in accordance with the consensus of opinion) is another matter that need not be investigated at this time" (p. 207). Notably, Gordon does *not* identify this form as Asherah (*ʾAṯirat*); he refers to it only as "the deity Y." The Asherah identification (*ʾaṯirat* → *asasaramu*) is a later scholarly inference based on phonetic similarity, not Gordon's explicit claim.
>
> An alternative reading merits consideration. The form *ya-sa-sa-ra-mu* may represent the Semitic root **י-ש-ר** (*y-š-r*) "to be straight, upright, righteous" with archaic mimation — the nominative case ending *-um* preserved in Akkadian and early West Semitic. Gordon himself argues that Minoan retains case endings (cf. *ki-re-ya-tu* with nominative *-u*, p. 208). Under this analysis, ***Yasharum*** would mean "The Upright One" — a divine epithet rather than a proper theonym.
>
> **Supporting evidence:**
> - The root *y-š-r* is productive in West Semitic divine/royal epithets: Heb. *Jeshurun* (יְשֻׁרוּן) as a name for Israel, the *Book of Jashar* (סֵפֶר הַיָּשָׁר), *mesharim* (מֵישָׁרִים) "equity/uprightness"
> - Mimation (*-um*) on Minoan forms would parallel Gordon's analysis of other case-marked nouns in the corpus
> - An epithet explains why "all Minoanists" recognized the form as divine without identifying a specific deity — titles like *Elyon* ("Most High") or *Shaddai* ("Almighty") function similarly
>
> **Phonetic difficulty:** The doubled *-sa-sa-* does not straightforwardly derive from *yashar*. Possible explanations include: (1) gemination in an intensive form (*yaššar* "he who makes straight"); (2) Linear A scribal convention for representing Semitic שׁ (/ʃ/); (3) a dialectal or morphological variant not yet understood. A comparative note: Middle English scribes used "ss" to represent the /ʃ/ sound in certain texts (e.g., *Ayenbite of Inwyt*, c. 1340; see Scragg, *A History of English Spelling*), demonstrating that "ss" for /ʃ/ is not unprecedented in syllabic or alphabetic writing systems facing phonemic gaps.
>
> **Theological implication:** Text I,4:c pairs this deity with Nergal, the Mesopotamian god of the underworld and divine judgment. If *Yasharum* rather than *Athirat*, the pairing yields "*Yasharum u-Nergal*" — "The Upright One and Nergal" — potentially representing cosmic justice: righteousness in life, judgment in death. This would evidence Minoan religious syncretism bridging West Semitic ethical concepts with Mesopotamian eschatology.
>
> The hypothesis remains speculative pending further analysis of Linear A phonology and morphology. It is offered here as an alternative to the consensus *Athirat* reading, which itself lacks definitive confirmation.

### 6. Phoenician Dedication Formulas

**Thesis**: The formula *(y)a-ta-no-L88* parallels Phoenician votive inscriptions.

**Evidence:**
- Five dedications open with *(y)a-ta-no-L88*
- Phoenician root *ytn* "to erect or set up (as a dedication)" is common from Karatepe onward
- Text I, 14: *ya-ta-no-L88 u ya-[ ]* parallels Phoenician יִתֵּן וְיָטַנְא "gave and set up"
- Text I, 8:a: *ta-nu-a-ti* = form of *tn'* "to set up"

## Notable Passages

> "We are now in the second phase of determining the Linear A language. The first phase began in 1957 with the Semitic identification of 'Minoan A'; the present study shows that the language is West Semitic, of the Phoenician type. Further refinements lie ahead."

— *Context*: The concluding methodological statement, marking the transition from general "Semitic" to specifically "Phoenician-type West Semitic."

> "Indo-Europeanists, including a dedicated group of Classicists, have been advancing our knowledge of the Mycenaean Greek Linear B tablets. Semitists have no right to expect the Indo-Europeanists to shoulder the responsibility of interpreting the Linear A documents as well. I hope this article will lead some Semitists—particularly young Hebraists—into a new and challenging field that will yield rich results in West Semitic linguistics."

— *Context*: Gordon's call for Semitists to engage with Minoan studies, challenging disciplinary boundaries.

> "That the Semitic names of Hagia Triada are primarily West Semitic has been abundantly clear for some time; e.g., *da-we-da*, 'David,' *da-gu-na*, 'Dagon,' *gu-pa₃-nu* = Ugaritic 'Gupanu,' and its feminine counterpart *gu-pa₃-na-tu*, etc."

— *Context*: Evidence for West Semitic deity and personal names at Hagia Triada.

## Methodological Notes

### "Probable Word" Technique

Gordon adapts cryptanalytic methodology: "Probable word" means a suitable word tried in attempting to break into a decipherment, then tested by what it leads or fails to lead to.

### Script Limitations

The Minoan syllabary does not distinguish:
- Unvoiced, voiced, and emphatic stops (*k, g, q* all written with same sign)
- Exception: voiced *d* is kept separate from *t / ṭ*

This affects readings: *ma-ka-we-te* = Ugaritic *mqwt* shows *k(a)=q* and *t(e)=ṭ*.
