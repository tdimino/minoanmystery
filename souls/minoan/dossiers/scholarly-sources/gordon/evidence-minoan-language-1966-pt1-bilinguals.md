## Overview

This opening section establishes the bilingual method as the foundation for Gordon's decipherment. Using Greek-Eteocypriote and Greek-Eteocretan bilinguals, Gordon demonstrates that the pre-Greek languages of Cyprus and Crete are Northwest Semitic dialects closely related to Phoenician. The bilinguals from Amathus and Dreros provide the "Rosetta Stones" that unlock the linguistic identity of the Minoan world.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: These bilinguals establish the empirical foundation for the Minoan-Semitic thesis. The Dreros equations (*lmo* = "for his mother," *ihia* = "it will be") prove continuity from Bronze Age Minoan through Hellenistic Eteocretan.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Historical Setting (§1–2)

Gordon frames Minoan civilization within the East Mediterranean koiné of the second millennium BC:

> "A comparative study of Ugaritic, Greek and Hebrew literatures points to a single culture that permeated the East Mediterranean throughout the second millennium B.C." (§1)

The fall of Knossos (ca. 1400–1200 BC) dispersed the Minoans, explaining:
- The sudden appearance of Ugaritic literature after 1400 BC
- References to Caphtor (Crete) as home of **Kothar-wa-Khasis**
- The spread of hide-shaped ingots from Crete to Anatolia and Sardinia

> "That god (Kothar-wa-Khasis) has a pure Semitic name, indicating that Caphtor had been the artistic center of the linguistic, cultural and religious sphere to which Ugarit belonged." (§1)

### 2. The Amathus Bilingual (§3–18)

The Greco-Eteocypriote bilingual from Amathus (Cyprus), inscribed on black marble, provides the first key equations.

**The Greek epitome**:
> Ἡ ΠΟΛΙΣ Ἡ ΑΜΑΘΟΥΣΙΟΝ ΑΡΙΣΤΩΝΑ ΑΡΙΣΤΩΝΑΚΤΟΣ ΕΥΠΑΤΡΙΔΗΝ
> "The city of the Amathusians (has honored) the noble Ariston (son) of Aristonax."

**Key Eteocypriote readings** (§7–17):

| Eteocypriote | Semitic | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| *a-na ma-to-ri* | הַנָּה מְתוֹרֵי | "the city" (= ἡ πόλις) |
| *a-na* | הַנָּא (Syriac *hānā*) | "the, this" |
| *sa-na* | זֶנָה | "this" (m. sg. demonstrative) |
| *-o-se* | אז | "this" (enclitic) |
| *la* | ל | "for" |
| *a-lo* | עָלָיו | "over him" |
| *ka* | כ | "like, as" |

**Double demonstrative construction**: *sa-na a-ri-si-to-no-se* "this Ariston" parallels Aramaic idiom (§17).

### 3. The Dreros Bilinguals (§19–31)

Two bilinguals from Dreros, Crete, with Eteocretan text preceding Greek—indicating Eteocretan was the principal local language.

#### First Dreros Bilingual (§20–27)

**Eteocretan** (retrograde, with word dividers):
```
]ΙΡΜΑΦ . ΕΤ . ΙΣΑΑΒΡ ΕΤ ΚΟΜΝ
]Σ . ΜΕΝ . ΙΝΑΙ . ΙΣΑΑΤΡΙΑ . ΑΜΟ
```

**Greek** (boustrophedon):
```
]Σ ΤΟΝ ΤΥΡΟΝ Μ[ΥΝ]Α ΤΟ ΑΟΙ ΕΦΑΣ[Ε
ΤΑΙ] ΜΑΤΡΙ ΤΑΙ Α[ΥΤΟ]
```

**Critical equation** (§22):
> "The final word in the Eteocretan is ΑΜΟ corresponding to ]ΜΑΤΡΙ ΤΑΙ Α[. Since ΜΑΤΡΙ can only be the dative for 'mother,' the Eteocretan ΑΜΟ is the equivalent of Hebrew לְאִמּוֹ *l'immō* 'for his mother.'"

**Other equations from First Dreros** (§23–27):

| Eteocretan | Greek | Semitic | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| ΕΤ ΚΟΜΝ | τὸν τυρόν | אֶת גֹּבֶן | "the cheese" (accusative) |
| ΕΤ | — | אֶת | sign of definite accusative |
| ΑΜΟ | μητρὶ | לְאִמּוֹ | "for his mother" |
| ΙΣΑΑ- | μύνα | אִשָּׁה | "woman" |
| ΑΒΡ | — | חָבֵר | "companion" |
| ΤΡΙΑ | — | רֵעַ | "friend" |

> "The First Dreros Bilingual provides Greek evidence that establishes the close Eteocretan correspondents of Hebrew/Phoenician ל 'to,' ו 'his,' אם 'mother' and the accusative indicator את. Even if we set aside the other Eteocretan readings, these four would fix the Dreros dialect as Northwest Semitic." (§27)

#### Second Dreros Bilingual (§28–31)

**Eteocretan**: `]Σ . ΤΥΣΡ ΜΗΡ ΙΗΙΑ`

**Greek**: `ΟΜΟΝΤΑΙ ΔΑΙΠΕΡ ΕΝ ΟΡΚΙΟΙΣΙ . Α[ ] ΚΑΘΑΡΟΝ ΓΕΝΟΙΤΟ`

**Critical equation** (§30–31):
> "What is clear is that Eteocretan ΙΗΙΑ corresponds to Greek γένοιτο 'let there be.' The Semitic ΙΗΙΑ (in Hebrew יִהְיֶה *yihyeh*) by itself means 'he will be.'"

This establishes the Hebrew verb היה "to be" in the Dreros dialect—a crucial morphological confirmation.

### 4. The Praisos Texts (§32–44)

Four funerary inscriptions from Praisos, spanning ca. 600–300 BC.

**Recurring element**: ΜΙΤ = Hebrew מֵת *mēt* "died" appears in all three texts where the first line survives.

**Key readings from Praisos**:

| Eteocretan | Hebrew | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| ΜΙΤ | מֵת | "died" |
| Υ | ו | "and" (as in Punic) |
| ΣΦΑΑ | שֶׁבַע | "7" |
| ΣΑΡ | עֶשֶׂר | "10" |
| ΤΖΑΑ | תֵּשַׁע | "9" |
| ΣΑΝΟ | זֶנָה | "this" (m. sg.) |
| ΟΣ | אז | "this" (enclitic) |
| ΜΟΣΕΛ | מוֹשֵׁל | "ruler" |
| ΚΑΡΚ | כַּרְךְ | "town" |
| ΝΑΣ | נָשׁ | "people" |
| ΙΡ | עִיר | "city" |

**Double demonstrative** (§37): ΣΑΝΟ ΜΟΣΕΛ ΟΣ = זה מושל זה "this ruler"—same construction as Eteocypriote.

**Formulaic phrase** (§33, 41): ΜΕ Υ ΜΑΡ ΚΡΚΟ ΚΑ ΕΣ Υ ΕΣ = מי הוא מר כרכו כל איש ואיש "whoever he be, lord of his town, every man and man"

### 5. The Psychro Text (§45–49)

A unique **digraphic** text from the Dictaean Cave (ca. 300 BC) where the scribe rewrites ΕΤΙΘΙ in Minoan syllabary as *i-pi-ti*:

```
ΕΤΙΘΙ
Ζ ΗΘΑΝΘΗ
ΕΝΕΤΗ ΠΑΡΣΙΦΑΙ
i-pi-ti
```

**Key readings**:

| Eteocretan | Phoenician | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| ΕΤΙΘΙ / *i-pi-ti* | הַפֵּתַח | "the engraved monument" |
| Ε | ה | "the" (definite article) |
| Ζ | ז | "this" or "which" (relative) |
| ΗΘΑΝΘΗ | יְתַנְתִי | "I have given/set" |

> "Four key words are clear: Ε = ה 'the,' ΙΤΙΘΙ = Minoan *pi-te* = פתח 'engraved monument,' Ζ = Minoan *za* = ז 'this' or 'which,' and *ytn* 'to give, set' as in Minoan and Phoenician." (§49)

This text proves **continuity from Minoan to Eteocretan**—the same terminology for votive monuments persisted for over a millennium.

### 6. Alphabet Development on Crete (§51–54)

Gordon argues the Greek alphabet with vowels was developed on Crete:

> "When the Cretans adopted the consonantal Phoenician alphabet, they added to it the means of expressing the five vowels to which they had so long been accustomed from their long use of the native syllabary." (§51)

**Key evidence**: Omicron corresponds to Phoenician ע (*'ayin*), which was pronounced *o* in Minoan words like *bol* (< *ba'l*) "Baal" and *nol* (< *na'l*) "sandal" (§53).

### 7. Eteocretan Grammar Summary (§55–113)

**Established Eteocretan Readings** (§113):

| Eteocretan | Semitic | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| ΑΒΡ | חָבֵר | "companion" |
| Ε | ה | "the" |
| ΕΣ | אֵשׁ | "man" |
| ΕΤ | אֶת | sign of accusative |
| Ζ | ז | "this" |
| ΗΘΑΝΘΗ | יְתַנְתִי | "I have given" |
| ΙΗΙΑ | יִהְיֶה | "it will be" |
| ΙΡ | עִיר | "city" |
| ΚΑΡΚ | כַּרְךְ | "town" |
| ΚΑ | כֹּל | "all" |
| ΚΟΜΝ | גֹּבֶן | "cheese" |
| Λ | ל | "to, for" |
| -Μ- | אֵם | "mother" |
| ΜΙΤ | מֵת | "died" |
| ΜΟΣΕΛ | מוֹשֵׁל | "ruler" |
| ΝΑΣ | נָשׁ | "people" |
| -Ο | ו | "his" |
| ΟΣ | אז | "this" |
| ΠΙΘΙ | פֵּתַח | "engraved monument" |
| ΡΙΑ | רֵעַ | "friend" |
| ΣΑΝΟ | זֶנָה | "this" |
| ΣΑΡ | עֶשֶׂר | "10" |
| ΣΦΑΑ | שֶׁבַע | "7" |
| ΤΖΑΑ | תֵּשַׁע | "9" |
| Υ | ו | "and" |

## Notable Passages

> "This monograph aims at providing qualified scholars with all the evidence they need for understanding the Northwest Semitic character of Minoan." (Foreword)

> "Eteocretan consists of a group of closely related and mutually intelligible Northwest Semitic dialects." (§50)

> "The only certain Eteocretan identification in the Second Dreros Bilingual so far is ΙΗΙΑ = γένοιτο. This establishes the Hebrew היה as the verb 'to be' in the Dreros dialect and corroborates the Northwest Semitic character of the Dreros dialect with a crucial word." (§31)
