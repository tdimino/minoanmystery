## Overview

This concluding section applies Gordon's acrophonic method to the Phaistos Disc, proposes a historical origin for the Minoans (Northwest Semites from the Egyptian Delta), and synthesizes the dialect evidence. Though Gordon acknowledges the Disc interpretation is "especially subject to correction" (Foreword), his acrophonic readings and the Delta hypothesis provide the capstone to his Minoan-Semitic thesis.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: The Phaistos Disc analysis demonstrates how acrophony works—the principle underlying the entire Linear A decipherment. The Delta hypothesis explains *why* a Semitic-speaking civilization arose on Crete ca. 1800 BC.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Phaistos Disc: Context and Method (§164–168)

#### Archaeological Context (§164)

> "The Phaistos Disc was found in a context of Linear A tablets and should go with Linear A linguistically. The script is related to Linear A as Egyptian Hieroglyphs are to Hieratic."

**Key insight**: The signs were pressed with dies into wet clay—"a simple kind of printing."

#### Acrophonic Principle Confirmed (§164)

> "What has emerged is that the phonetic values are derived acrophonically from the Semitic words that the pictographs portray. This means that the script was devised for the Minoan language and not for some still undeciphered tongue."

**Implication**: Once a pictograph is matched with the right Semitic word, the sign can be pronounced.

#### Spiral Writing (§165)

The Disc is written spirally, continuing the tradition of:
- Knossos magic bowl II,1
- Aramaic Incantation Bowls of Sasanian Mesopotamia

#### Profile Pictographs (§166)

A peculiarity: All bodies and heads are in profile. The LIONESS head corresponds to the Linear A *ma*-sign (which faces front).

#### Direction of Script (§168)

H. D. Ephron determined on mechanical grounds that the script runs **left to right**, beginning at the center—like the magic bowls.

### 2. Acrophonic Sign Values (§167, 171–175)

Gordon and B. Schwartz identified several sign values:

| Sign | Value | Semitic Word | Meaning |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| FLYING BIRD | *ku* | *kudr-* (Ugaritic/Syriac) | "vulture, bird of prey" |
| SANDALED FOOT | *no* | *nōl-* < *naʿl-* | "sandal" (with ʿayin > o shift) |
| BOAT | *su* | Hebrew *sĕfīnā* | "boat" |
| MOUTH | *pe* | Hebrew *pē* | "mouth" |
| BARLEY | *ʾi* | Egyptian *it* | "barley" (loanword) |
| MAN | *pu/bu* | Ugaritic *bu-nu-šu* | "man" |
| HOUSE (ground plan) | *pa/ba* | Semitic *bayt* | "house" |
| HORN | *kr-* | Semitic *karn-* | "horn" → "town" (*krk*) |
| LIONESS | *ma* | Egyptian *mꜣit* | "lioness" (loanword) |
| BREAST | *ha* | *haynīq* | "to suckle" |
| CORNER | *pi* | Hebrew *pinnā* | "corner" |

### 3. Key Disc Readings (§169–175)

#### The *no-ha-na-ma* Word (§169)

A word occurs thrice: once simple, twice with suffix.

| Form | Syllables | Linear A Parallel |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| ⌂⚪⟁⟠ | *no-ha-na-ma* | *no-x-na-ma* |
| ⌂⚪⟁⟠⊗ | *no-ha-na-ma-ti* | *no-x-na-mi-na* (m. pl.) |

The suffix *-ti* is feminine plural, vs. Linear A masculine plural *-mi-na*.

#### The "Town" Word — HORN + *ku* (§170)

> "A frequent word occurring five times in the Disc is written HORN + *ku*. The Semitic word for 'horn' is *karn-*. However, we know from the early Eteocretan text from Praisos (§33) that the word for 'town' was pronounced *krk* (as distinct from *kark*, which appears later). Accordingly, *krn-* (rather than *karn-*) would be the Minoan pronunciation of the word for 'horn.' HORN + *ku* should therefore be read *kr-ku* 'town.'"

This matches the high frequency of "town" in both the Disc and the Praisos texts.

#### The Ceremonial Meal Formula (§174)

| Disc Signs | Reading | Ugaritic Parallel |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| BOAT-MOUTH-BARLEY-? | *su-pe-ʾi-ti* | *spīt* "I have eaten" |

> "Now the latter [*spīt*] is used in a magico-religious context 'to eat a ceremonial meal in the house of Baal.'"

**Full phrase**: *su-pe-ʾi-ti* followed by CORNER-MAN-*te-ha-da* = *pi-pu-te-ha-da*

**Interpretation**: The combination *pu-te* (occurring 5 times) = Ugaritic *bwt* "house, temple"

The final syllables *ha-da* = oblique case of הדד *Hadda* = Ugaritic *hd* = another name of Baal.

> "We have here a parallel to the religious rite of eating a ceremonial meal in the Shrine of Baal (cf. Ugaritic *spī ksmh bt bʿl* in text 2 Aqht:I:32)... If this is correct, the shrine connected with the Phaistos Palace is the Temple of Baal/Hadd." (§174)

#### Phaistos in the Disc (§175)

The HOUSE sign depicting a ground plan should have value *pa/ba* (from *bayt* "house").

> "Since a repeated cluster begins with *pa-i-* in a context that mentions *kr-ku* 'town,' the cluster may begin with *pa-i-to* 'Phaistos': as it is spelled out in both Linear A and B."

### 4. Conclusions on the Disc (§176)

> "More work remains to be done on the Disc but it seems to be in the same Semitic language as Linear A. It shows that the Minoan script is acrophonic. Its analogues with Egyptian writing confirm what should have been evident from the orthographic convergence of l and r and from the similarity of certain signs like that for WINE: the Minoan script reflects the Egyptian system."

## Chapter XV: Minoan Origins (§177–179)

### The Architectural Evidence (§177)

Professor Clark Hopkins observed that Minoan architecture points to southern origins:

- **Absence of hearth** (essential in Greece, Anatolia)
- **Emphasis on light and air**
- **Stress on birds and flowers in ornamentation**

Hopkins suggests: Cyprus, Cilician coast, Syria (even south of the Orontes).

### The Delta Hypothesis (§178)

> "When we ask ourselves what historic factor impelled the palace builders to occupy Crete in MM I, we must consider the establishment of the Middle Kingdom under Upper Egyptian leadership against the non-Egyptians who had become too strong in the Delta."

**Gordon's argument**:

1. The entire East Mediterranean was permeated with Northwest Semites
2. The Delta was never "pure Egyptian" like Upper Egypt—it was "Levantine" with large Semitic population
3. Egypt was called "The Two Lands" for good reason
4. At the end of the First Intermediate Period (= MM I), Upper Egypt expelled non-Egyptians from the Delta
5. The palace-building Minoans arrived on Crete precisely then (MM I)

> "We can now answer, in broad outline, who the palace-building Minoans were, that imposed their already highly developed Bronze Age civilization on Neolithic Crete. They were Northwest Semites mainly from the Delta. However, they were essentially the same people as the other Northwest Semites in Libya, Palestine, Phoenicia, Syria, etc., so that it would be a mistake to insist that all of the early Minoans came exclusively from the Delta." (§178)

### Greek Tradition Confirms (§179)

> "Greek tradition tells us that Belos and his sons Aigyptos and Danaos were from Northeast Africa but were not Egyptians; they were Phoenicians. We can now understand the tradition."

As F. H. Stubbings noted: "Aeschylus is at pains to demonstrate that though [Danaos] came from Egypt he was not an Egyptian."

---

## Chapter XVI: The Dialects (§180)

### Mutual Intelligibility

> "Our survey of Minoan, Eteocretan and Eteocypriote shows that we are dealing with a variety of very closely related Northwest Semitic dialects. The ancient Greeks applied the name 'Phoenician' to the language and the people who spoke it."

**The dialect spectrum**:
- Phoenician proper (Byblos, Tyre, Sidon, Arvad, Cilicia, Cyprus)
- Minoan-Eteocretan-Eteocypriote

All were **mutually intelligible**.

### The Synthesis

> "The close kinship of Minoan and Hebrew explains the common background of early Greek and early Israelite civilizations." (§180)

| CORNER | *pi* | *pinnā* | "corner" | Hebrew |
| HORN | *kr-* | *karn-* → *krn-* | "horn" → "town" | Praisos *krk* |

## The Continuity Thesis (Synthesis)

Gordon's monograph establishes a continuous linguistic tradition:

| Period | Script | Language | Attestation |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| MM I–LM I (2000–1400 BC) | Linear A | Minoan | Hagia Triada, Knossos, Phaistos |
| LM I–LM III (1400–1200 BC) | Linear A/B overlap | Minoan + Mycenaean | Transitional |
| ca. 600–300 BC | Greek alphabet | Eteocretan | Dreros, Praisos, Psychro |
| ca. 300 BC | Cypriote syllabary | Eteocypriote | Amathus |

All represent **one Northwest Semitic language family**, mutually intelligible with Phoenician.
