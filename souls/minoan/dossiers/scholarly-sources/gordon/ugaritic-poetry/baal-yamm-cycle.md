## Overview

These three texts narrate the cosmic conflict between Baal (storm god) and Yamm (Sea/Judge River). Yamm first wins kingship and has Kothar-wa-Hasis build his palace. He then demands Baal as slave, and El surrenders him. Finally, Baal defeats Yamm using two magic clubs fashioned by Kothar-wa-Hasis—Aymr ("Driver") and Ygrš ("Expeller").

## Text 129: Yamm's Palace

*Yamm wins kingship and Kothar-wa-Hasis builds his palace.*

> [Thereupon] he sets face toward El
> At the sources [of the Two Rivers]
> [In the midst of the streams of the Two Deeps].
> [He enters] the abode of El
> [And comes into the domicile of the King, [Father of Snm].
> [At the feet of El he bows] and falls
> Prostrates himself and honors [him].
>
> [ ]
> Kothar-and-Ha[sis ] house of Sea
> [ ] palace of Judge River.
> Thy bosom [ ]
> **Build the house of Prince Sea**
> **[Ere]ct the pala[ce of Judge] River**
> In the midst of [ ]
> [ ] build [ ]
> [ ] erect [ ]
>
> [ ] lad to the fields, words
> [ ] in the sea.
> Sea [ ] Athtar of [ ]
> [ ] fire
> [ ] bring [ ] son(s)
> [ ] the Luminary of the Gods, Sun.
>
> She lifts her voice
> And [shouts]:
> "[Hea]r!- - - -
> Thor-El, thy father, [ ]
> To the presence of Prince Sea
> [ Judge Riv]er
> Will not Thor-El, thy father, hear thee?
> Will he not remove [the props of thy throne]?
> [Nor up]set [the chair] of thy kingship?
> Nor break the scepter of thy government?"
>
> And [ ] replies:
> "[ ] against me, Thor-El, my father.
> As for me, [I have] no house [like] the gods
> Nor a court [like the deiti]es!
> To the womb, I'll descend
> When I'm reborn the Kothars will wash me
> In the hou[se] of Sea
> In the palace of Judge River."
>
> Thor-El, his father, - - - -, Judge [ ]:
> "[Judg]e River, thou art King!
> [ ] mayest thou reign!
> Lo, there is no wife, [ ] like
> [ ] Prince Sea
> [ ] Judge River
> [ ] he will send me."
>
> And Athtar replies: [ ]

**Note**: *Snm* is a deity sired by El. "Tôr" (pronounced "Thôr"), "the Bull," is identified with El, the head of the pantheon.

## Text 137: Yamm's Demand

*Yamm sends messengers demanding Baal be handed over. El surrenders Baal as a slave.*

> "Thou has arisen against [ ]"
> [And] Aliyan Baal [replies]:
> "[ ]
> On thy head, Aymr [ ]
> [On thy pate Ygrš]!"
>
> [And] Judge River [replies]:
> "May [Horon] break, [O Baal]!
> [May Horon break] thy head
> Astarte-[Name-of Baal, thy pate]!"
> [ ] Staff fall in By[blos ]
> [ ] two women [ ]
> [me]ssengers sends Sea [ ]

**Note**: *Aymr* ("Driver") and *Ygrš* ("Expeller") are the names of war clubs fashioned by Kothar-wa-Hasis. The first stuns the foe; the second vanquishes him.

### Yamm's Arrogant Message to the Divine Assembly

> "Depart, lad[s]!
> [Do not sit!]
> [Then] ye shall surely set [face]
> Toward the Convocation of the Assembly
> In the midst of the mountain of Night].
> [At the feet of El] do not fall
> Do not prostrate yourselves before the Convocation [of the Assembly]
> But declare your information!
> And say to Thor, [my] father, [El]!
> [Declare to the Convocation] of the Assembly:
>
> 'The message of Sea, your lord,
> Of your master Ju[dge River]:
> **"Give up, O gods, him whom you harbor**
> **Him whom the multitude harbor!**
> **Give up Baal [and his partisans]**
> **Dagon's Son, so that I may inherit his gold!"** '"

### The Gods' Fear

> The lads depart
> They do not sit.
> [Then] they set [face]
> Toward the mountain of Night
> Toward the Convocation of the Assembly.
> The gods had not even sat down
> The deities to dine,
> When Baal stood up by El.
>
> As soon as the gods saw them
> Saw the messengers of Sea
> The emissaries of Judge River
> **The gods lowered their heads upon their knees**
> **Yea upon the thrones of their lordships.**

### Baal's Rebuke

> Baal rebukes them:
> "Why, O gods, have ye lowered
> Your heads on top of your knees
> Yea upon the thrones of your lordships?
> Let a pair of gods read
> The tablets of the messengers of Sea
> Of the emissaries of Judge River!
> O gods, lift up your heads
> From the top of your knees
> Yea from the thrones of your lordships!
> And I shall answer
> The messengers of Sea
> The emissaries of Judge River."
>
> The gods lift their heads
> From on top of their knees
> Yea from the thrones of their lordships.

**Note**: The gods who could read were apparently a pair of divine scribes, as divine messengers (and many other deities) came in pairs.

### El Surrenders Baal

> They say to Thor, his father, El
> "The message of Sea, your lord,
> Of your master, Judge River:
> 'Give up, O gods, him whom ye harbor
> Him whom the [multitudes] harbor!
> Give up Baal and his partisans
> Dagon's Son, so that I may inherit his gold!' "
>
> **[And] Thor, his father, El, [replies]:**
> **"Baal is thy slave, O Sea!**
> **Baal is thy slave, [O S]ea!**
> **Dagon's Son is thy captive!**
> **He will bring thy tribute like the gods**
> **He will bring [ ]**
> **Like the deities, thy gift!"**

### Baal's Fury

> But Prince Baal is infuriated.
> [A knife he tak]es in the hand
> A dagger in the right hand.
> To smite the lads he flo[urishes them/it].
>
> [Ana]th seizes [his right hand]
> Astarte seizes his left hand:
> "How [canst thou smite the messengers of Sea],
> [The emis]saries of Judge River?
> The messengers - - - - - - [ ]
> [ ] messengers on the shoulders
> Word of his lord and [ ]"
> But Prince Baal is infuriated.

## Text 68: Baal Vanquishes Yamm

*Baal defeats Yamm using the magic clubs fashioned by Kothar-wa-Hasis.*

> [ ] dead [ ]
> [ ] alive [ ]
> I shall bring them out
> Also I shall drive out [ ]
> [ ] and in the sea - - - - -
> In the sea two bosoms [ ]
> [Judge] River - - - - there two swords - - - - I shall kiss [ ]
>
> "To the earth let our mighty one fall
> Yea to the dust, our strong one."
>
> [From] his mouth the word had not yet gone forth
> Nor from his lips, his utterance
> And his voice was given forth
> Like a mountain under the throne of Prince Sea.

### Kothar's Prophecy

> And Kothar-and-Hasis declared:
> "Did I not tell thee, O Prince Baal,
> Nor declare, O Rider of Clouds?
> **'Lo, thine enemies, O Baal,**
> **Lo, thine enemies wilt thou smite**
> **Lo, thou wilt vanquish thy foes**
> **Thou wilt take thine eternal kingdom**
> **Thine everlasting sovereignty!'"**

**Note**: This passage has a verbal parallel in Psalm 92:10:
> "For lo thine enemies, O Yahweh,
> For lo thine enemies shall perish,
> All doers of iniquity will be scattered"

### The Magic Clubs

> Kothar brings down two clubs
> And proclaims their names.
>
> "Thy name, even thine, is **Expeller**!
> Expeller, expel Sea
> Expel Sea from his throne
> River from the seat of his sovereignty!
> Thou shalt swoop from the hands of Baal
> Like an eagle from his fingers!
> Strike the shoulders of Prince Sea
> 'Twixt the hands of [Jud]ge River!"
>
> The club swoops from the hands of Baal
> Like an eagle from his fingers.
> It strikes the shoulders of Prince Sea
> 'Twixt the hands of Judge River.
>
> **Sea is strong**
> **He is not vanquished**
> **His joints do not fail**
> **Nor his frame collapse.**

### The Second Club: Victory

> Kothar brings down two clubs
> And proclaims their names.
>
> "Thy name, even thine, is **Driver**!
> Driver, drive Sea
> Drive Sea from his throne
> River from the seat of his sovereignty!
> Thou shalt swoop from the hands of Baal
> Like an eagle from his fingers!
> Strike the head of Prince Sea
> 'Twixt the eyes of Judge River!
> Let Sea sink
> And fall to earth!"
>
> And the club swoops from the hands of Baal
> Like an eagle from his fingers.
> It strikes the head of Prince [Sea]
> 'Twixt the eyes of Judge River.
>
> **Sea sinks**
> **Falls to earth**
> **His joints fail**
> **His frame collapses**
>
> Baal drags and poises Sea
> Destroys Judge River.

### Astarte's Rebuke

> By name, Astarte rebukes:
> "Shame, O Aliyan Baal,
> Shame, O Rider of Clouds!
> For Prince Sea was our captive
> For Judge River was our captive."
>
> And there went out B[aal ]
> Verily ashamed is Aliyan Baal
> And [Prince] Sea is indeed dead
> **So let Baal rei[gn]!**
