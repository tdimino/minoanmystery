## Overview

The Epic of Aqhat is the tale of the righteous King Danel, his model son Aqhat, and his avenger daughter Pughat. After seven days of offerings and incubation, Baal grants Danel a son. Kothar-wa-Hasis brings the boy a wondrous bow. The huntress goddess Anath covets it, offering first wealth, then immortality. Aqhat refuses both, adding that archery is not for women. Anath plots his murder through Yatpan, who strikes him while eagles hover overhead. One eagle devours Aqhat's remains. Drought and famine follow. Danel curses the land, retrieves Aqhat's remains from the mother of eagles, mourns for seven years, then sends his daughter Pughat to exact vengeance. She dons warrior's garb beneath women's clothes and infiltrates Yatpan's camp—where the text breaks off.

**Biblical Significance**: Danel's curse parallels David's lament over Gilboa (II Samuel 1:21). Pughat's transvestism explains Deuteronomy's prohibition on cross-dressing. Ezekiel 14:14 and 28:3 mention Danel by name.

## Part I: Danel's Seven-Day Offering

*The childless king offers sacrifices for a son.*

> The gods will eat the offerings
> The deities will drink the offerings.
> He proceeds, ascends to his loft
> And he lies down
> He proceeds, spends the night.
> Lo a day and a second
> The offerings, the gods, Danel!
> The gods eat the offerings
> The deities drink the offerings.
> A third, a fourth day
> The offerings, the gods, Danel!
> A fifth, a sixth day
> The offerings, the gods, Danel!
> **Danel proceeds to his loft**
> **He proceeds to his loft and ascends**
> **And he lies down clad in a garb**
> **And spends the night.**

---

## Part II: Baal Intercedes

*Baal petitions El for Danel's blessing.*

> "The wretchedness of Danel, Man of Rp',
> The sigh of the Hero, Man of Hrnmy,
> **Who has no son like his brothers**
> **Nor a root like his kinsmen!**
> Indeed he possesses no son like his brothers
> Nor a root like his kinsmen!
> The gods eat the offerings
> The deities drink the offerings.
> Will they not bless him to Thor-El, my father,
> Nor defend him to the Creator of Creatures
> **So that a son of his may be in the house**
> **A root in the midst of his palace?**

### The Duties of a Model Son

> One who sets up the stela of his ancestral gods in the shrine
> Who lays his people to rest on the earth
> Sends out his incense from the dust
> The soldier of his post
> Who heaps the tablets of his office
> Expels him who eats the supper of his spending the night
> **Who takes his hand in drunkenness**
> **Who carries him when sated with wine**
> Who eats his meal in the house of Baal
> His portion in the house of El
> **Who plasters his roof on the day of mud**
> **Who washes his clothes on the day of slime."**

---

## Part III: Danel's Joy

*El blesses Danel with a son.*

> On Danel, the face rejoices
> Yea above, the temple gleams.
> He cracks a smile
> And laughs.
> Feet on the footstool he sets.
> He lifts his voice
> And shouts:
>
> **"I shall sit and rest**
> **And my soul shall repose in my breast**
> **For a son is born unto me like my brothers**
> **Even a root like my kin."**

---

## Part IV: The Kosharot

*Divine songstresses attend the birth.*

> Danel goes to his house
> Danel reaches his palace.
> **There enter his house the Kosharot**
> **The daughters of shouting, the swallows.**
> Thereupon Danel, Man of Rp',
> Slaughters an ox for the Kosharot
> He feeds the Kosharot
> He gives the daughters of shouting, the swallows, to drink.
> Lo a day and a second
> He feeds the Kosharot...
> A fifth, a sixth day
> He feeds the Kosharot...
> **Lo on the seventh day**
> **There depart from his house the Kosharot**
> **The daughters of shouting, the swallows.**

---

## Part V: Kothar Brings the Bow

*The craftsman god brings a wondrous bow for Aqhat.*

> **"I bring a bow**
> **I fetch an arc."**
> And behold on the seventh day
> Thereupon Danel, Man of Rp',
> Picks himself up
> Yea he sits
> **In the enclosure of the gate**
> Under the dignitaries which is in the threshing floor.
> **He judges the case of the widow**
> **Adjudicates the cause of the fatherless.**

### Gordon's Note

> "Ancient city gates often had an enclosure for official proceedings. 'Threshing floor,' in the next line, designates the place where court was held."

### Kothar's Arrival

> On lifting his eyes
> He perceives
> By the thousand acres
> Myriad hectares
> **He spies the going of Kothar**
> **He spies the course of Hasis.**
> Lo he brings a bow
> Behold he fetches an arc.

### The Feast for Kothar

> "Hear, Lady Danatay!
> Prepare a lamb from the flock
> **For the soul of Kothar and Hasis**
> **For the appetite of the Skilled of Handicraft!**
> Feed, give drink to, the gods
> Serve and honor them
> **Lords of Hkpt**
> **Gods of all of it!"**
>
> Lady Danatay hearkens...
> After Kothar and Hasis come,
> **In the hands of Danel they set the bow**
> **On his knees they place the arc.**

### Gordon's Note on Hkpt

> "'All' of a land is an idiom (found in the Northwest Semitic dialects, including Aramaic) designating all the provinces or divisions of a country. Here both parts of Hkpt are intended, i.e., Upper and Lower Egypt."

---

## Part VI: Anath Covets the Bow

*The goddess offers wealth for the bow.*

> On lifting her eyes
> She sees
> She lifts her voice
> And shouts:
>
> "Hear, O Aqhat the Hero!
> **Request silver and I'll give thee**
> **Gold, and I'll endow thee!**
> **But give me thy bow**
> **Let the Progenitress of Heroes take thine arc!"**

### Aqhat's First Refusal

> "The mightiest sinews of Lebanon
> The mightiest tendons from buffaloes
> The mightiest horns from wild goats
> The mightiest stems of reeds:
> **Give (such) to Kothar and Hasis**
> **So that he may fashion a bow for her**
> **An arc for the Progenitress of Heroes."**

---

## Part VII: The Offer of Immortality

*Anath offers eternal life.*

> **"Request life, O Aqhat the Hero!**
> **Request life and I'll give thee!**
> **Immortality and I'll endow thee!**
> **I shall cause thee to count years with Baal**
> **With the son of El shalt thou count months**
> **Like Baal as he lives!"**

### Aqhat's Fatal Refusal

> **"Do not beguile me, O Virgin!**
> **For to a hero thy lies are loathsome!**
> **As for man, what does he get as his destiny?**
> **What does man get as his fate?**
> **Lime is poured on the head**
> **Plaster on top of my pate.**
> **And I'll die the death of everyone**
> **Yea I shall surely die!**
> Also another thing I shall tell:
> **The bow is a weapon of heroes**
> **Could a female really hunt therewith?"**

### Anath's Threat

> Anath laughs aloud
> But in heart - - -:
>
> "Reconsider, O Hero Aqhat,
> Reconsider for my sake and thine!
> Otherwise shall I not meet thee on the path of sin
> Nor fell thee on the path of pride
> Under my feet, O Good One, strongest of men?"

---

## Part VIII: Anath Extorts Permission from El

*She threatens El to get her way.*

> She enters the abode of El
> Comes into the domicile of the king, Father of Snm.
> At the feet of El she bows and falls
> Prostrates herself and honors him.
> She slanders Aqhat the Hero
> Maligns the child of Danel, Man of Rp'.
>
> **"I shall make thy gray hair flow with blood**
> **The gray of thy beard with gore.**
> **And then will Aqhat save thee**
> **Or will Danel's son rescue thee**
> **From the hand of the Virgin Anath?"**

### El's Reply

> "I know thee, my daughter, that thou art impetuous
> And there is no forbearance among goddesses.
> So depart, my daughter - - -
> Evil is thy heart
> The joy that there is in thy liver
> Thou shalt put in the midst of thy breast.
> **Let thy heels surely thresh."**

---

## Part IX: The Murder Plot

*Anath hires Yatpan to kill Aqhat.*

> The Virgin Anath goes to Yatpan, Soldier of the Lady
> She lifts her voice
> And shouts:
>
> **"I shall make thee like an eagle with my sheath**
> **Like a bird with my scabbard.**
> Aqhat, as he will sit down to eat
> Yea the son of Danel to dine
> Over him eagles will soar
> There will hover a flight of birds
> **Among the eagles I shall be flying**
> **Over Aqhat I shall poise thee.**
> **Strike him twice on the head**
> **Thrice over the ear!**
> Spill, like a slayer, blood
> Like a slaughterer, on his knees.
> Let his soul go out like the wind
> Like a gust, his spirit
> **Like smoke out of his nose!"**

---

## Part X: The Murder

*Aqhat is struck down.*

> She takes Yatpan, Soldier of the Lady,
> She makes him like an eagle with her sheath
> Like a bird with her scabbard.
> As Aqhat sits down to eat
> The son of Danel to dine
> Over him eagles soar
> There hovers a flight of birds.
> **Among the eagles soars Anath**
> **Over Aqhat she poises him**
> **He strikes him twice on the head**
> **Thrice over the ear.**
> He spills like a slayer his blood
> Like a slaughterer on his knees.
> His soul goes out like wind
> Like a gust, his spirit
> **Like smoke, out of his nose.**

### Anath's Lament

> The Progenitress of Heroes weeps, saying:
>
> "Aqhat I shall repair
> Yea for the bow was he smitten
> Only indeed for the arc
> But thou shalt surely live..."

---

## Part XI: Danel's Curse

*Drought and famine follow the hero's death.*

> Pughat weeps in her heart
> She sheds tears in the liver
> She tears the garment of Danel, Man of Rp',
> The garb of the Hero, Man of Hrnmy.
> Thereupon Danel, Man of Rp', prays:
>
> **"Clouds in the heat of the evil of the early rains**
> **Clouds that rain on the summer fruit**
> **Dew that falls on the grapes!**
> **Seven years may Baal afflict thee**
> **Eight, the Rider of Clouds!**
> **Let there be no dew**
> **Let there be no rain**
> **Let there be no surging of the Two Deeps**
> **Let there be no goodness of Baal's voice!"**

### Biblical Parallel: David's Lament (II Samuel 1:21)

> "O mountains of Gilboa
> Let there be no rain
> Let there be no dew upon you!"

**Gordon's Comment**: "Danel and David react in the same way and express themselves in almost identical words because the culture and literature of heroic Israel stemmed from the heritage of Canaan."

---

## Part XII: Retrieving Aqhat's Remains

*Danel searches the eagles.*

> "May Baal break the wings of the eagles
> May Baal break their pinions
> That they may fall under my feet!
> I'll split their inwards and look
> If there is fat
> If there is bone
> I shall weep
> And bury him
> **I'll put him in the grave of the gods of the earth."**

### The Threefold Search

| Eagle | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Flock of eagles | No fat, no bone |
| Hrgb, Father of eagles | No fat, no bone |
| **Ṣml, Mother of eagles** | **Fat and bone found** |

> The word had not yet gone from his mouth
> From his lips, his utterance
> When Baal broke the wings of Ṣml...
> She fell under his feet.
> He splits her inwards and looks
> **There is fat**
> **There is bone**
> **And he takes Aqhat therefrom**
> **He weeps and buries**
> **He buries him in a sepulcher**

### Gordon's Note

> "The text achieves an atmosphere of suspense by telling how Danel first brings down the flock of eagles without retrieving Aqhat's remains; then he brings down the father of the eagles, but again in vain. Only on the third try, when he brings down the mother of the eagles, does he find Aqhat's remains for burial."

---

## Part XIII: The Seven Years of Mourning

*Danel mourns, then sends Pughat.*

> Danel proceeds to his house
> Danel reaches his palace
> The weeping women enter his palace
> He weeps for Aqhat the Hero
> Sheds tears for the Child of Danel, Man of Rp'.
> **From days to months**
> **From months to years**
> **Until the seventh year**
> He weeps for Aqhat the Hero.

---

## Part XIV: Pughat's Mission

*The daughter seeks vengeance.*

> Then declared Pughat
> Who shoulders water:
>
> "Make, O Father, a sacrifice to the gods
> Offer up an offering unto heaven!
> Wilt thou not bless me that I may go blessed
> Protect me that I may go protected?
> **I'll smite the smiter of my brother**
> **Yea destroy the destroyer of my sibling!"**

### Danel's Blessing

> "By my soul let Pughat live
> Who shoulders water
> Pours dew on the barley
> **Knows the course of the stars!**
> May she prosper!
> **Mayest thou smite the smiter of thy brother**
> **Destroy the destroyer of thy sibling!"**

### Gordon's Note on Pughat's Virtues

> "These are the virtues of a model daughter: she looks after the water and food supplies, and is skilled at divining."

---

## Part XV: The Transvestism

*Pughat disguises herself.*

> She washes
> And rouges herself
> With a rouging from the husk
> She dons a hero's garb
> **She puts a weapon in its holder**
> **A sword she puts in its scabbard**
> **And over it she wears a woman's garb.**

### Biblical Connection

Gordon notes that Pughat's transvestism explains why Deuteronomy 22:5 forbids cross-dressing:

> "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God."

This prohibition is a reaction against Canaanite practice attested in the Epic of Aqhat.

---

## Part XVI: Infiltrating Yatpan's Camp

*The text breaks off mid-scene.*

> From the rising of the Luminary of the Gods, Sun
> To the setting of the Luminary of the Gods, Sun.
> **Pughat reaches the tents.**
> Word is brought to Yatpan:
> "Our mistress has come into thine abode
> Pughat has come hither."
>
> And Yatpan, Soldier of the Lady, answers:
> "Receive her and give her to drink
> The wine of the cup in my hand
> The chalice in my right hand!"

### Yatpan's Boast

> "The hand that smote the Hero Aqhat
> Will smite thousands of my lady's foes!"

### Pughat's Response

> Pughat like - - - her heart
> **Like a serpent, hissing**
> Twice she drinks that mixture
> Drinks that mixture.

*[Text breaks off here]*

## Part XVII: Fragmentary Conclusion

Gordon notes that the extant fragments do not preserve Aqhat's restoration to life, but this is anticipated in the text and required by Hebrew allusions to the Epic.

---

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Danel** | Righteous king, Man of Rp' (Rapha) |

## Biblical Parallels

| Aqhat | Bible |
|-------|-------|
| Danel | Ezekiel 14:14, 28:3 mentions Danel by name |
| Seven days of offering | Sabbatical pattern |
| Danel's curse | David's lament (II Samuel 1:21) |
| Pughat's transvestism | Deuteronomy 22:5 prohibition |
| Kosharot | Psalm 68:7 (*košārôt*) |
| Model son's duties | Honoring parents (Decalogue) |

## Minoan Connections

### Gordon's Note on Minoan Architecture

> "My student Miss Alexandra Lambropoulou makes the acute observation that Minoan architecture fits this passage, which calls for the king to sit at a lower level than the nobles but to be able to see the approaching god. By the main entrance at both Knossos and Phaistos is an open court with tiered rows of seats for the nobles."

### Long Locks and Curls

> "The locks and curls are typical of the early heroes; cf. the long-haired Achaeans of Homer, Samson's locks, and especially **the Minoan fashion of long locks for men**."
