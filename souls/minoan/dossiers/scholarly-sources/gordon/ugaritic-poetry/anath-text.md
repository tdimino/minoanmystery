## Overview

The Anath text forms part of the Baal Cycle. Column I describes a divine banquet with wine and minstrelsy. Column II narrates Anath's bloodthirsty rampage that nearly destroys mankind—a massacre symbolizing victory, followed by the blessings of peace. Columns III-IV tell how Baal induces Anath to visit his mountain by promising to reveal "the secret of nature." When messengers arrive, Anath fears danger threatens Baal and boasts of her past victories: defeating Yamm (Sea), Tannin (Leviathan), Mot (Death), and other cosmic enemies.

**Significance**: This text contains Anath's famous "battle boast" listing her defeated enemies—the same monsters (Leviathan, the seven-headed serpent, Tannin) that appear in Isaiah 27:1 and Psalm 74:14. Gordon notes: "We are dealing with a specific borrowing, not with the reappearance of a universal theme."

## Part I: The Divine Banquet

*A feast with wine and sacred music.*

> "Do not lower [
> Serve Aliyan Baal
> Honor the Prince, Lord of Earth."
> He proceeded to prepare (a repast)
> So that he might feed him.
> He put a breast before him
> With a keen knife
> A slice of fatling.
> He began to prepare beverages
> So as to give him to drink.
> He set a cup in his hand
> A goblet in both his hands.
> From the mighty cherub we - - - -
> The men of heaven saw not the sacred cup
> The women of the goblet eyed not Asherah.
> **A thousand pitchers he took from the wine**
> **A myriad he mixed with its mixture.**
> He proceeded to sing and chant
> **With cymbals in the hands of the Good One**
> **The lad, good of voice, sang**
> **About Baal in the heights of Saphon.**

## Part II: Anath's Bloodthirsty Rampage

*The goddess decimates mankind in battle.*

> And the lads chance upon the Lady of the Mountain
> **And lo Anath smites in the valley**
> Fighting between the two cities
> **She smites the people of the seashore**
> **Destroys mankind of the sunrise.**

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 14)
> "The pair of opposites (seashore = west, and sunrise = east) indicates totality, as antonymic pairs frequently do. The meaning is that Anath is decimating all of mankind."

### The Severed Heads and Hands

> **Under her are heads like vultures**
> **Over her are hands like locusts**
> Like thorns of *grmn*, the hands of troops.
> She piles up heads on her back
> She ties up hands in her bundle.
> **Knee-deep she plunges in the blood of soldiery**
> **Up to the neck in the gore of troops.**
> With a stick she drives out foes
> Against the flank she draws her bow.

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 15)
> "I.e., the air is full of the heads and hands she is hacking off her victims."

## Part III: The Massacre Continues

*Anath returns home but is not satisfied.*

> And lo Anath reaches her house
> Yea the goddess enters her palace
> **But is not satisfied.**
> She had smitten it in the valley
> Fought between the two cities.
>
> She hurls chairs at the troops
> Hurling tables at the soldiers
> Footstools at the heroes.
> Much she smites and looks
> Fights and views.
> **Anath gluts her liver with laughter**
> **Her heart is filled with joy**
> **For in Anath's hand is victory.**
> For knee-deep she plunges in the blood of soldiery
> Up to the neck in the gore of troops.
> **Until she is sated she smites in the house**
> Fights between the two tables
> Shedding - - - - the blood of soldiery
> **Pouring the oil of peace from a bowl.**

### The Washing After Battle

> The Virgin Anath washes her hands.
> The Progenitress of Heroes, her fingers.
> **She washes her hands in the blood of soldiery**
> **Her fingers in the gore of troops.**
> Arranging portions by the chairs
> Tables by the table(s)
> Footstools she arranges by the footstools.
> She gathers water and washes
> **With dew of heaven**
> **Fat of Earth**
> **Rain of the Rider of Clouds**
> The dew that the heavens pour
> The rain that the stars pour.

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 16)
> "Note that the style calls for duplicating the battle scene. In line 19 above it is stated that Anath was not satisfied with the bloodshed in the first foray. Accordingly she sallied forth on another battle and this time she was satisfied. This feature of the literature is of the greatest importance in understanding Hebrew and Greek literatures."

## Part IV: The Blessings of Victory

*Fertility follows Anath's triumph.*

> **The anhb-animals leap by the thousand acres**
> **The zuh-fish in the sea, by the myriad of hectares.**

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 18)
> "The victory of Anath results in dew and rain, fertility of the soil, and abundance of game and fish. The main goal of this mythological literature is to secure life and fertility and to avert death and sterility."

## Part V: Baal's Message

*Baal sends messengers to summon Anath.*

> Place corals on her chest as a gift

> The devotion of Tallay, girl of rain,
> The love of Arṣay, girl of Ycbdr.
> Like lads and harbinger(s)
> At Anath's feet bow and fall
> Prostrate yourselves, honor her
> And say to the Virgin Anath
> Declare to the Progenitress of Heroes:

> **The word of Aliy the Warrior:**
> "Put bread in the earth
> Place mandrakes in the dust
> Pour a peace offering in the midst of the earth
> A libation in the midst of the fields!
> To me let thy feet run

## Theological Significance

### The Dualistic Struggle

Gordon emphasizes that this text demonstrates the specific Canaanite origin of biblical dualism:

> "The slaying of the seven-headed Leviathan by the god(s) of goodness shows that the dualistic conflict between good and evil entered the biblical tradition with the absorption of the pre-Hebraic heritage of Canaan."

> "The terminology (not only 'Leviathan,' but also his epithets, such as 'the evil serpent,' 'the crooked serpent,' and 'Tannin,' as in Isaiah 27:1) leaves no doubt, for it is verbally identical in Ugaritic and Hebrew. **We are dealing with a specific borrowing, not with the reappearance of a universal theme.**"

### The Rider of Clouds

Gordon's footnote 34 notes:
> "The epithet 'Rider of Clouds,' applied to Baal at Ugarit, was applied to Yahweh in Israel (Psalm 68:5; 68:4 in the King James Bible). The epithet is appropriate to the storm god. Hebrew monotheism necessitated the transfer of the functions of the nature gods to Yahweh."
