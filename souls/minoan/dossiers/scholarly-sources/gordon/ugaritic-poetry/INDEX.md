## Key Theological Notes

### The Yw-El Revelation (Footnote 25)

From [baal-palace.md](./baal-palace.md):

> "'Yw-El' is the son of the head of the pantheon. This suggests that 'Yahweh' ('Yw') was originally El's son in pre-Israelite Canaan. It is usual for a younger god to eclipse the older gods in the development of religion. In other words, just as Zeus eclipsed his father Cronus, Yahweh eclipsed his father El. Subsequently, Hebrew monotheism necessitated the identification of Yahweh with El."

### The Leviathan Connection

From [anath-text.md](./anath-text.md):

> "The terminology (not only 'Leviathan,' but also his epithets, such as 'the evil serpent,' 'the crooked serpent,' and 'Tannin,' as in Isaiah 27:1) leaves no doubt, for it is verbally identical in Ugaritic and Hebrew. **We are dealing with a specific borrowing, not with the reappearance of a universal theme.**"

### Kōhănîm vs. Qĕdēšîm

From the parent [ugarit-minoan-crete-ch2-greco-hebrew.md](../ugarit-minoan-crete-ch2-greco-hebrew.md):

> "This illustrates the fact that the Hebrews sometimes **borrowed from** (as in the case of the *kōhănîm*), and at other times **reacted against** (as in the case of the *qĕdēšîm*), their Canaanite milieu."
