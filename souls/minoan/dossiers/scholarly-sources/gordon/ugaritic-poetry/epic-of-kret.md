## Overview

The Epic of Kret tells of King Kret whose destined wife has departed before giving him an heir. Through incubation, El appears in a dream and instructs Kret how to retrieve the lady Hurrai from King Pbl of Udum. Kret marshals his army, makes a vow to Asherah, and retrieves Hurrai. El blesses the union with seven sons and a daughter (Octavia). However, Kret fails to fulfill his vow, falls ill, and nearly dies. After divine intervention cures him, his son Yaṣib claims the throne, and Kret curses him.

**The Helen-of-Troy Motif**: This epic contains the same wife-retrieval pattern found in Homer's Iliad (Menelaus/Helen/Troy) and Genesis 12, 20 (Abraham/Sarah/Egypt and Gerar).

## Part I: Kret's Lament (Krt Text)

*Kret weeps for his destroyed household and departed wife.*

> Destroyed is the house of the [k]ing
> Who had seven brothers
> Eight sons of one mother.
> **Kret, our scion, is improvised**
> **Kret, despoiled of a place.**
> His rightful wife he could not get
> Nor his destined bride.
> A woman did he bethroth
> But she departed.
>
> Siblings germane were to be his:
> (But) a third die at birth
> A fourth, of disease
> A fifth Reshef gathers in
> A sixth are youths (victims) of the sea
> A seventh, lo they fall by the sword.
>
> Kret sees his progeny
> He sees his progeny impoverished
> Greatly despoiled, his seat and house.
> Lo a family is perished
> And in his castle (perished is) an heir.
>
> He enters his chamber, he weeps
> While uttering words, shed tears
> His tears are poured
> Like shekels earthward
> Like fifth-shekels on the bed.
> As he weeps, he falls asleep
> As he sheds tears, slumber
> Yea sleep overcomes him
> And he lies down in slumber
> And (then) is startled.

## Part II: El's Dream Revelation

*El descends in Kret's dream and questions him.*

> And in his dream El descends
> In his vision the Father of Man.
> And he draws near while asking Kret:
> **"Who is Kret that he should weep**
> **The Good One, Lad of El, that he should shed tears?**
> **Does he wish the kingship of [Th]or, his Father?**
> **Or sovereignty, li[ke the Fa]ther of M[an]?"**

**Note**: Ugaritic calls man "Adam," exactly as in Hebrew.

### El's Instructions for Sacrifice

> "Thou shalt wash
> And rouge thyself!
> Wash thy hands to the elbow
> From thy fingers to the shoulder!
> Enter [the shade of the tent]!
> Take a lam[b in thy hands]
> A lamb of sa[crifice in] the right
> A kid in b[oth]
> Loaves of [thy] b[read] of - - -
> Take the entr[ails] of a bird of sacrifice
> Po[ur] wine [from a c]up of silver
> Honey from a cup of [g]old
> And rise to the top of the [to]wer
> Ride the shoulders of the wal[1]
> Lift thy hands heavenward
> Sacrifice to Thor, thy Father, El
> Bring Baal down with thy sacrifices
> Dagon's Son with thy victuals!
> And let Kret go down from the roof."

## Part III: The Army Musters

*Kret prepares for the campaign to retrieve Hurrai.*

> "Prepare food for the city
> Wheat for the House of Hbr
> Bake bread of the fifth
> Provisions of the sixth month.
> The multitude is noble
> And the army goes forth
> A noble army,
> And there goes forth the multitude of rank-and-file
> Thine army, a great host:
> **Three hundred myriads.**
> Troops without number
> Soldiers without reckoning."

**Note**: Kret's city is Hbr, not Ugarit.

### Total Mobilization

> "Let the solitary man close his house
> The widow indeed be hired
> The invalid carry the bed
> The one-eyed indeed - - -
> Let the newly wed groom come forth
> To drive his wife to another
> To a stranger his well-beloved
> **Like locusts they shall occupy the field,**
> **Like grasshoppers the corners of the desert.**"

**Note**: In a national emergency, everyone must serve. The newly wed groom must join the army and dispose of his bride.

> And occupy the towns
> Invest the cities
> Capture the man gathering wood in the fields

> **Yea cause the girl to enter my court**

## Part VI: King Pbl's Offer

*King Pbl offers riches but Kret demands only Hurrai.*

> King Pbl could not sleep
> For the sound of the bellowing of his bull
> For the voice of the braying of his ass

> Take silver
> Even gold
> A share of her estate
> And a permanent slave
> A team of three horses
> A chariot from the yard of a handmaid's son
> Take, Kret, peace offerings in peace
> And depart, King, from my house
> Be distant, Kret, from my court!
> Do not besiege Great Udum
> And Little Udum
> **Udum is a gift of El**
> **A present of the Father of Man.**' "

### Kret's Reply: Only Hurrai

> "What use have I for silver
> Even of gold
> A share of her estate
> And a permanent slave
> A team of three horses
> A chariot from the yard of a handmaid's son?
> **But what is not in my house shalt thou give!**
> **Give me Lady Hurrai**
> **The fairest of thy firstborn's family**
> **Whose charm is like Anath's charm**
> **Whose loveliness is like Astarte's loveliness**
> Whose brows are lapis lazuli
> Eyes, bowls of alabaster!
> Let her gird me [ ]
> That I may repose in the view of the eyes of her
> Whom El granted in my dream
> In my vision the Father of Man,
> **That a scion be born unto Kret**
> **Yea a lad to the Servant of El.**'"
