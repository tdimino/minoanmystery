## Overview

Text 51 narrates the construction of Baal's palace by Kothar-wa-Hasis. All gods except Baal have houses; Baal enlists Anath and Asherah to petition El for permission. El approves, and Kothar builds a magnificent palace of cedar, transformed by divine fire into gold and silver. The centerpiece is the "window controversy"—Kothar insists on installing a window while Baal refuses, though Baal eventually relents. Gordon notes this reflects the introduction of windowed palaces from Crete to Ugarit, since Minoan architecture featured windows while Ugaritic did not.

**Critical Footnote**: This text also preserves the name "Yw-El" (Yahweh-El), suggesting Yahweh was originally El's son in pre-Israelite Canaan.

## The Yw-El Revelation

*From the divine naming passage preceding Text 51.*

> And Lṭpn, God of Mercy, replies:
> **"The name of my son is Yw-El."**

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 25)

> "'Yw-El' is the son of the head of the pantheon. This suggests that 'Yahweh' ('Yw') was originally El's son in pre-Israelite Canaan. It is usual for a younger god to eclipse the older gods in the development of religion. In other words, just as Zeus eclipsed his father Cronus, Yahweh eclipsed his father El. Subsequently, Hebrew monotheism necessitated the identification of Yahweh with El."

**Significance**: This passage provides textual evidence that the divine name Yahweh predates Israelite religion and originally designated a son of El within the Canaanite pantheon. The theological development from polytheistic son-god to monotheistic identification with El parallels the Greek pattern of Zeus superseding Cronus.

## Part I: Baal Has No House

*All gods have dwellings except Baal.*

> "(There are) the dwelling of El
> The shelter of his sons
> The dwelling of Lady Asherah of the Sea
> The dwelling of the renowned brides
> The dwelling of Pidray, girl of light,
> The shelter of Tallay, girl of rain,
> The dwelling of Arṣay, girl of Yebdr.
> Also something else I'll tell thee
> Go to!
> Beseech Lady Asherah of the Sea
> Entreat the Creatress of Gods!"

## Part II: Kothar at His Forge

*The craftsman god prepares offerings for Asherah.*

> The Skilled One goes up to the bellows
> In the hands of Hasis are the tongs.
> **He pours silver**
> **He casts gold**
> He pours silver by thousands (of shekels)
> Gold he pours by myriads
> He pours *hym* and *tbth*
> **A glorious crown weighing two myriads**
> **A glorious crown studded with silver**
> **Adorned with red gold.**
> A glorious throne
> A dais above a glorious footstool
> Which glisters in purity.
> Glorious shoes of reception
> Thereover he brings them gold.
> A glorious table that is full
> Whatever - - - of the earth's foundations.
> **A glorious bowl, fine work of Kamares**
> Set like the realm of Yman
> In which there are buffaloes by myriads.

**Note**: The "fine work of Kamares" refers to the distinctive Minoan pottery style from Crete, connecting Kothar's craftsmanship to Aegean artistic traditions.

## Part III: Asherah's Reaction

*Asherah sees Baal and Anath approaching with gifts.*

> On lifting her eyes
> She sees
> Asherah sees Baal's going
> Yea the going of the Virgin Anath
> The tread of the Progenitress of Heroes.
>
> She lifts her voice
> And shouts:
> "Why has Aliyan Baal come?
> Why came the Virgin Anath?
> Is it that my smiters or the smiters of my sons
> [the b]and of my kin?"
>
> **[Ashe]rah sees the silver**
> **The shadow of silver**
> **And the [gleam] of gold.**
> **Lady Asherah of the Sea is glad.**

---

## Part IV: Baal's Disgrace

*Baal complains to the divine assembly about his humiliation.*

> He proceeds to spit in the midst of the assembly of the gods:
> "I have drunk [disgrace] from my table
> Scorn from a cup did I drink.
> **Baal hates two sacrifices**
> **Three, the Rider of Clouds:**
> The sacrifice of shame
> And the sacrifice of baseness
> And the sacrifice of the abuse of handmaids
> For therein shame is seen
> And therein is the abuse of handmaids."

---

## Part V: The Journey to El

*Asherah rides to petition El.*

> "Saddle an ass,
> Hitch a donkey!
> Put on harness of silver
> Trappings of gold
> Prepare the harness of my jennies!"
>
> Qadish-and-Amrar hearkens
> He saddles an ass
> Hitches a donkey
> Puts a harness of silver
> Trappings of gold
> Prepares the harness of her jennies.
> Qadish-and-Amrar embraces
> He sets Asherah on the back of the ass
> On the beautiful back of the donkey.
> Qadish begins to light the way
> Even Amrar like a star.
>
> Then she sets face toward El
> **At the sources of the Two Rivers**
> **In the midst of the streams of the Two Deeps.**
> She enters the abode of El
> And comes into the domicile of the King, Father of Snm.
> At the feet of El she bows and falls
> Prostrates herself and honors him.

---

## Part VI: El's Welcome

*El greets Asherah warmly.*

> As soon as El sees her
> He cracks a smile and laughs.
> His feet he sets on the footstool
> And twiddles his fingers
> He lifts his voice
> And shouts:
> "Why has Lady Asherah of the Sea come
> Why came the Creatress of Gods?
> Art thou hungry?
> Then have a morsel!
> Or art thou thirsty?
> Then have a drink!
> Eat!
> Or drink!
> Eat bread from the tables!
> Drink wine from the goblets!
> **From a cup of gold, the blood of vines!**
> If the love of El moves thee
> Yea the affection of Thor arouses thee!"

---

## Part VII: El Grants Permission

*El authorizes the palace construction.*

> And Ltpn, God of Mercy, replied:
> "Am I to act as a lackey of Asherah
> And am I to act like the holder of a trowel?
> If the handmaid of Asherah will make the bricks
> **A house shall be built for Baal like the gods**
> **Yea a court like the sons of Asherah.**"
>
> And Lady Asherah of the Sea replied:
> "Thou art great, O El,
> Thou art verily wise!
> **The gray of thy beard hath verily instructed thee!**
> Lo, also it is the time of his rain.
> Baal sets the season
> And gives forth his voice from the clouds
> He flashes lightning to the earth.
> As a house of cedars let him complete it
> Or a house of bricks let him erect it!
>
> **The mountains will bring thee much silver**
> **The hills, the choicest of gold;**
> **The mines will bring thee precious stones**
> **And build a house of silver and gold**
> **A house of lapis gems!"**

---

## Part VIII: The Window Controversy

*Kothar advocates for a window; Baal refuses.*

> And Kothar-and-Hasis declares:
> "Hear, O Aliyan Baal!
> Perceive, O Rider of Clouds!
> **I shall surely put a window in the house**
> **A casement in the midst of the palace!"**
>
> And Aliyan Baal replies:
> **"Do not put a window in the house**
> **A casement in the midst of the palace!"**
>
> And Kothar-and-Hasis replies:
> **"Thou wilt return, Baal, to my word."**

### Gordon's Note (Footnote 26)

> "The excavations at Ugarit convey the impression that windows were not in general use. Minoan architecture, on the other hand, included windows. **The disagreement between Baal and Kothar thus reflects the introduction of windowed palaces from Crete to Ugarit.**"

**Significance**: This architectural detail connects Kothar's Cretan workshop (Caphtor) to his innovative building techniques. The window controversy encodes cultural contact between Minoan Crete and the Levant.

## Part IX: The Seven-Day Transformation

*Kothar builds the palace with divine fire.*

> Of cedars his house is to be built
> Of bricks is his palace to be erected.
> He goes to Lebanon and its trees
> To Syria (and) the choicest of its cedars.
> Lo, Lebanon and its trees
> Syria (and) the choicest of its cedars.
> **Fire is set on the house**
> **Flame on the palace.**
>
> Behold a day and a second
> The fire eats into the house
> The flame into the palace.
> A third, a fourth day
> The fire eats into the house
> The flame into the palace.
> A fifth, a sixth day
> The fire eats into the house
> The flame in the midst of the palace.
>
> **Behold on the seventh day**
> **The fire departs from the house**
> **The flame from the palace.**
> **Silver turns from blocks**
> **Gold is turned from bricks.**
>
> Aliyan Baal rejoices.
> **"My house have I built of silver**
> **My palace of gold have I made."**

## Part X: The Housewarming Feast

*Baal celebrates with the seventy sons of Asherah.*

> His house, Baal prepares
> Hadd prepares the housewarming of his palace.
> He slaughters great and small cattle
> He fells oxen and ram-fatlings
> Yearling calves
> Little lambs and kids.
>
> **He called his brothers into his house**

## Part XI: Baal Relents

*Baal asks Kothar to install the window after all.*

> As Baal went into the midst of the house
> Aliyan Baal declared:
> "I would install, Kothar, son of the Sea,
> Yea Kothar, son of the Assembly!
> **Let a casement be opened in the house**
> **A window in the midst of the palace**
> **And let the clouds be opened with rain**
> On the opening of Kothar-and-Hasis."
>
> **Kothar-and-Hasis laughed.**
> He lifts his voice
> And shouts:
> **"Did I not tell thee, O Aliyan Baal,**
> **That thou wouldst return, Baal, to my word:**
> **'Let a casement be opened in the house**
> **A window in the midst of the palace!'"**
>
> Baal opened the clouds with rain
> His holy voice he gives forth in the heavens.

---

## Part XII: Mot's Challenge

*Death challenges Baal's kingship.*

> Mot calls from his throat
> The Beloved meditates in his inwards:
> **"I alone am he who will rule over the gods**
> **Yea command gods and men**
> **Even dominate the multitudes of the earth."**

---

## Colophon

> "[ ] the Ṯc-ite; Niqmad, king of Ugarit."

**Gordon's Note**: "This line, on the edge of the tablet, is a colophon giving the name of the scribe (who belonged to the influential tribe of Ṯaʿ) and the name of the king (Niqmad II) during whose reign the tablet was written."
