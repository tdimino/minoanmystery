## Overview

This technical article presents Gordon's mature methodology for deciphering Minoan and Eteocretan inscriptions. He outlines six methods of decipherment, works through the Dreros bilinguals, demonstrates the Semitic character of Eteocretan through variant phrases, and connects Minoan Linear A to Eteocretan through shared vocabulary (*ku-ro* "all/total", *u* "and"). The Psychro stone inscription is fully translated as a Northwest Semitic dedication formula.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This is Gordon's most methodologically rigorous article, establishing the six-method framework for Minoan-Eteocretan decipherment and providing detailed bilingual readings that anchor the Northwest Semitic identification.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Six Methods of Decipherment

Gordon explicitly outlines six methods applicable to Minoan and Eteocretan:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| (i) **Bilingual method** | Greek-Eteocretan bilinguals provide known-to-unknown equations |
| (ii) **Phrase translation** | Whole Eteocretan phrases tested for meaning and internal consistency |
| (iii) **Inner variants** | Synonyms and alternative idioms within Eteocretan texts confirm readings |
| (iv) **Parallel unilinguals** | Greek and Eteocretan unilinguals from same sites provide equivalences |
| (v) **Contextual method** | All readings must fit context |
| (vi) **Collateral evidence** | Interpretation within known East Mediterranean epigraphical usage |
| (vii) **Pictograms/determinatives** | For Minoan, meaning fixed through accompanying pictographs |

**Key quote**: "The material dictates the methods. There is no one prefabricated methodology for deciphering all scripts and languages."

### 2. The Dreros Bilinguals

**First Dreros Bilingual:**
- Eteocretan opens with *]φμαF* = Greek *EΦ AΔE* "they decreed"
- Eteocretan ends with *λμο* = Greek *[τα]ματρίτα[τα]ο* "for his mother"
- Analysis: *λμο* = Hebrew *l-immō* "for his mother"

**Second Dreros Bilingual:**
- Demonstrates additional Greco-Eteocretan correspondences
- Confirms Northwest Semitic character

**Key quote**: "The Greek version tells us to equate λμο with Hebrew לִאמוֹ *l'immô* 'for his mother'."

### 3. The All-Inclusive Adjuration Formula

Gordon demonstrates that Eteocretan contains standardized adjuration formulas found throughout East Mediterranean epigraphy.

**Eteocretan phrase**: *ετ·μενυμαρκρκοκλες·νες...*
- = Hebrew *...מי הוא מר כרכו כל איש ואיש* "whosoever he be, citizen of his fortress (or) any (other) man and man of..."

**Variant phrasing**: *vas φονκλες* "the people of his city and every (other) man"

**Parallel construction in known languages:**
- **Phoenician (Tabnit)**: *m y't k l'd m's...* "whosoever thou art, any man who..."
- **Phoenician (Eshmunazar)**: *qnmy't kl mmikt wkl'd m* "my oath is with every ruler and every (other) man"
- **Phoenician (Azitawadd)**: *w'm mlk bmlkm wrzn brznm'm'd m's' 'd m šm* "and if any king among kings..."

**Key insight**: The two Eteocretan variants provide synonymous pairs—*mar krk* "lord of fortress" and *vas ir* "people of city"—that only make sense in Northwest Semitic.

### 4. Minoan-Eteocretan Linguistic Continuity

Two key words bridge Minoan (Bronze Age) and Eteocretan (Early Iron Age):

**1. *ku-ro* / *kull-* "all, total"**
- Introduces numerical totals in Hagia Triada tablets
- = Semitic *kull-* "all"
- Biblical parallel: 2 Sam. 23:39 sums up David's heroes with *kol* "total: 37"

**2. *u* "and"**
- Connects parallel utterances in Minoan dedications
- Example: *ya-ta-no-x u ya-[...]* "he donated it and set [it up as votive offering]"
- = Phoenician *ytn wytn'* "he donated and set up as votive offering"

**Key quote**: "We have shown that two common words (of types not likely to be borrowings) are shared by Minoan and Eteocretan: *kull-* 'all', *u* 'and'."

### 5. The Psychro Stone Translation

The complete translation of the Psychro stone inscription from the Dictaean Cave:

**Text**: *επιθίζηθανθη* + syllabic *i-pi-ti*

**Translation**: "I, E. the son of S., have donated this engraved stone."

**Analysis:**
- *epithi* = *e-pth* "the engraved stone" (with definite article *e-*)
- = Phoenician *pth* "engraved stone" (cf. YHWMLK inscription: *pthy z* "this engraved stone of mine")
- *ζηθανθη* = *ytnt-* "I have donated" (cf. Punic *ytnty*)
- The first word repeated in Minoan syllabary (*i-pi-ti*) proves scribe knew both scripts

**Addendum**: Robert Stieglitz solved the third line *ενετηπαρσιφαι* as "E. the son of S." where *par* = "son" (standard Aramaic, also Phoenician KLMW inscription and Hebrew Prov. 31:2).

### 6. The Wine-Wheat Evidence

**Wine (*ya-ne*):**
- Inscribed on Knossos pithos fragment
- = NW Semitic *yayn-* "wine"
- Michael Astour noted: Ugaritic place "Yan(a)" written *ya-na* or GESTIN-*na* (where GESTIN = wine)
- This gives an isogloss connecting Minoan and Ugaritic

**Wheat (*ku-ni-su*):**
- Four occurrences in Hagia Triada tablets, twice with wheat determinative
- = Akkadian *kunnishu* "emmer wheat"
- Position in tablets fixes meaning as commodity (not personal name)

## Notable Passages

> "Like virtue, it should be practiced, but not necessarily talked about." (p. 148, on methodology)

— *Context*: Gordon's wry observation that method should be applied constantly but need not be discussed at every turn.

> "Neither the scholars who oppose the Semitic identification of Minoan... nor those who are bringing welcome support to it should go on ignoring the existence of Eteocretan." (p. 152)

— *Context*: Gordon's frustration that scholars treat Minoan and Eteocretan as separate problems when they form a linguistic continuum.

> "Blind denial is no more scientific than blind acceptance. What is needed is understanding the facts of the case; not disregard, polemics, denigration, nor the polarization of scholars into opposing camps." (p. 152)

— *Context*: Gordon's call for scholarly engagement with the actual evidence rather than ideological positioning.
