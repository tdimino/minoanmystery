## Overview

This chapter presents Gordon's core thesis that Minoan civilization was founded by Northwest Semitic "Delta folk" who brought palace culture, syllabic writing, and Canaanite religion to Crete around 1800 BC. Gordon demonstrates the Semitic character of Linear A through the acrophony principle, Eteocretan bilinguals, and the pantheon of Hagia Triada tablets. This is the most technically important chapter for understanding Gordon's decipherment methodology.

**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the key evidence for the Minoan-Semitic thesis—the acrophony principle, bilingual readings, and deity identifications that connect Minoan Crete to the Ugaritic/Canaanite cultural sphere from which Kothar-wa-Hasis originates.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Delta Origins of Minoan Civilization

**Thesis**: Minoan civilization appeared suddenly in MM I (ca. 1800 BC) fully developed, without prior evolution on Crete. The palace builders came from the Nile Delta.

**Evidence:**
- Pre-Minoan Cretans were still Neolithic when the palace builders arrived
- Minoan palaces have no built-in hearths—unsuited to Cretan winters, suggesting southern origin
- Light-and-air wells expose interiors, aggravating heating problems
- Egyptian artifacts, ivory, and gold in Cretan excavations confirm Delta connections
- Genesis 10:13–14 derives "Philistines" and "Caphtorians" from Egypt

> "The southern clime whence the Minoan palace builders came is not hard to determine. It must have been the Nile Delta, for Cretan archaeology has yielded a host of artifacts imported from, or imitating the workmanship of, Egypt."

**Key quote**: "Thus the forerunners of classical Greek and Hebrew cultures were kindred Delta folk."

### 2. The Acrophony Principle

**Thesis**: Linear A/B syllabic values derive from the initial consonant+vowel of Northwest Semitic words depicted by the pictographic signs.

**Evidence table:**

| Pictograph | Syllabic Value | Semitic Word | Meaning |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| MAN | *bu* | Ug. *bunushu* | "man" |
| BOAT | *si* | Ug. *sipinatu* | "boat" |
| APPLE | *tu* | Ug. *tuppuhu* | "apple" |
| BIRD-OF-PREY | *ku* | Ug. *kudru* | "bird of prey" |
| MOUTH | *pe* | Heb. *peh* | "mouth" |
| CORNER | *pi/bi* | Ug. *pinnatu* | "corner" |
| BARLEY | *i* | Eg. *it* | "barley" |
| BREAST | *ha* | NW-S *hayniq* | "to nurse" |

**Key quote**: "This principle, known as acrophony, indicates that Minoan writing was invented for the Northwest Semitic language whose vocabulary provides the syllabic values for the signs that Ventris discovered cryptanalytically in complete ignorance of the Semitic language."

### 3. Eteocretan Bilinguals

**Thesis**: Eteocretan (Greek-letter inscriptions from Crete, 600–300 BC) is simply late Minoan, proving linguistic continuity for over a millennium.

**Dreros First Bilingual:**
- Greek: ends with *matri* "for mother" (space for "his" broken)
- Eteocretan: ends with *lmo*
- Analysis: *lmo* = Hebrew *l-immō* "for his mother"

**Dreros Second Bilingual:**
- Greek: ends with *katharōn génoito* "let there be purity"
- Eteocretan: last word is *ihia*
- Analysis: *ihia* = Hebrew *yihye* "it will be" (jussive "let there be")

**Psychro Stone:**
- Written in Greek letters with first word *epithi* repeated in Minoan syllabic: *i-pi-ti*
- Analysis: = Phoenician *pth* "engraved stone" with definite article *e-*

**Key quote**: "The Eteocretan text from Psychro is fortunately a religious dedication that perpetuates some of the old Minoan terminology found in the eighteen known Linear A dedications, thereby proving that Eteocretan is a continuation of Minoan."

### 4. The Hagia Triada Pantheon

**Thesis**: The deities receiving offerings in the Hagia Triada tablets are Canaanite gods known from Ugarit.

**Deity identifications:**

| Linear A | Ugaritic | Identity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| *A-du* | Addu/Haddu | Baal (storm god) |
| *Gu-pà-nu* | Gupanu | Vine god |
| *Gu-pà-na-tu* | — | Female counterpart of Gupanu |
| *A-ga-ru* | Ugaru | God of the field |
| *Ki-re-tá* / *Ki-re-ta-na* | Krt/Krtn | Divine king, son of El and Asherah |
| *Ya-mo* | Yamm | Sea god |
| *Ti-ni-ta* | Thinith | "Our great Lady" (Tanit) |

**The wheat equation (quasi-bilingual):**
- Linear A: *ku-ni-su* + WHEAT determinative
- Linear B: *si-to* + same WHEAT determinative
- Analysis: *ku-ni-su* = Akkadian *kunnishu* "emmer wheat"; *si-to* = Greek *sítos* "wheat"
- Conclusion: This equation confirms Semitic character of Linear A

### 5. Minoan Semitic Vocabulary and Grammar

**Thesis**: Not just nouns but also verbs, pronouns, conjunctions, numerals, and prepositions in Linear A are Northwest Semitic—ruling out loanword explanations.

**Examples:**
- Verbs: "to be," "to give/donate," "to set up as offering"
- Pronouns: "he," "his," "this," "all" (*ku-lo* = Heb. *kol*)
- Conjunctions: "and" (*u*), "or"
- Numerals: "seven," "nine," "ten"
- Preposition: "to, for" (*le-*)

**Key quote**: "The grammar and syntax are Semitic, so that the Northwest Semitic nature of Minoan is established by the primary evidence."

## Notable Passages

> "Ancient tradition points plainly to the 'Phoenician' (i.e., Northwest Semitic) character of the Minoan language. Minos was the son of the Tyrian princess Europa. Her brother Cadmus founded Thebes. 'Europa' and 'Cadmus' are an appropriate pair of Semitic names, meaning 'West' and 'East,' respectively."

— *Context*: Gordon cites Greek mythological tradition as evidence for the Semitic character of Minoan culture. The names Europa (West) and Cadmus (East) form a complementary pair.

> "The knowledge that the Minoan language was 'Phoenician' persisted until at least the fourth century A.D., when a Latin author, Lucius Septimius, described the accidental discovery of ancient literary texts at Knossos in the reign of Nero. The texts were brought to Nero, who assumed them to be Phoenician and turned them over to Semitists for translation."

— *Context*: Gordon notes that ancient tradition preserved knowledge of Minoan as Phoenician, which modern scholarship erroneously rejected.

> "We have rich literary remains from Ugarit, but little so far from Minoan Crete. This is due to the accidents of discovery... Meanwhile the known Minoan texts suffice to bridge the gap between Ugarit and Greece, and show us that Northwest Semites laid the Minoan foundations for Mycenaean civilization: the first Greek culture in recorded history."

— *Context*: The concluding statement of the chapter, summarizing Gordon's thesis about the Minoan bridge between Semitic East and Greek West.

## Scholarly Lineage

### Builds On

- **W. C. Brice**: Standard corpus of Linear A inscriptions
- **Charles Virolleaud**: Ugaritic textual publication
- **E. A. Speiser**: Hurrian studies, Nuzi parallels

### Disputes
- **Classical consensus**: That Minoan was pre-Indo-European or related to Anatolian languages
- **Evans's followers**: Who maintained Minoan was unrelated to any known language family
- **Ventris-Chadwick school**: Who implied Linear A might be "Minoan Greek" or related

### Influences
- Michael C. Astour's *Hellenosemitica* (1965) extends Gordon's thesis
