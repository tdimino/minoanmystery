## Overview

A biographical and intellectual history of Cyrus Gordon's work on Minoan Linear A, written by his former student. Rendsburg traces Gordon's engagement with Minoan from his 1931 "brooding" to his mature identification of the language as West Semitic (1957-1966). The article defends Gordon against classicist dismissals, arguing that critics typically lacked Semitic training to evaluate his proposals. Includes important methodological observations about the Eblaite parallel and the application of Minoan evidence to biblical studies.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Gordon's Early "Brooding" (1931)

Gordon's interest in Minoan began on his first voyage to the Near East:

> "One June night as we were sailing along the coast of Crete, I was sitting with a group of companions on deck, and I was impelled to express my thoughts somewhat as follows: 'The Minoan inscriptions from this island are the main challenge to the decipherers of tomorrow. Someone with the necessary knowledge will succeed, through hard and honest work, in deciphering Minoan.'" (Gordon 1971:154-5, cited p. 36)

This "quarter century of brooding" prepared Gordon for his breakthrough after Ventris's Linear B decipherment.

### 2. Crete as the Mediterranean Hub

Gordon's Minoan work emerged from his broader vision of Mediterranean interconnections:

> "Gordon saw that Ugarit was much more than a major source of Canaanite literature providing invaluable material for the background of the Hebrew Bible. For Gordon, Ugaritic was a bridge which spanned the worlds of the Hebrews and the Greeks... Moreover, it became clear to Gordon that the hub which connected these worlds was Crete (*kptr* is the home of *Kothar-wa-Hasis*, the Ugaritic god of arts and crafts; his correspondent in the Greek pantheon is *Hephaistos*, whose home is also Crete; the Philistines of the Bible emigrated to Canaan from Caphtor; and so on)." (p. 36)

### 3. Initial Identification: East Semitic (1957)

Gordon's first published work identified Minoan vessel names with Semitic cognates:

| Linear A | Semitic | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| *si-ru* | Ugaritic *spr* | vessel type |
| *ka-pa* | Ugaritic *kpn* | vessel type |
| *su-pu* | Ugaritic *spr* | vessel type |
| *ku-ni-su* | Akkadian *kunāšu* | emmer wheat |
| *ki-ro* | Semitic *kall* | all, total |

> "The result was a short article in the journal *Antiquity* (Gordon 1957b) hailed by its editor O. G. S. Crawford as 'hot news of a startling new discovery' (Crawford 1957:123)." (p. 38)

### 4. Shift to West Semitic (1962)

New readings from Brice's *Inscriptions in the Minoan Linear Script of Class A* (1961) led Gordon to revise his identification:

| Linear A | West Semitic | Meaning |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| *ja-ne* | Hebrew *yayin*, Ugaritic *yn* | wine |
| *ki-re-ta* (?) | West Semitic | city (?) |
| *a-qa-nu* / *a-ka-nu* | Hebrew/Aramaic *ʾāqānāʾ* | bowl |
| *u* | Akkadian/Semitic *u* | and |

> "It was these words, and others like them, that led Gordon to realize that he had been off track—by just a few years. For the models do not support the East Semitic, but rather the West Semitic." (p. 38)

### 5. The Minoan-Eteocretan Continuum

Sidney Davis's work led Gordon to extend his analysis to Eteocretan texts (written in Greek alphabet, but non-Greek language):

> "Although Davis argued that Minoan was Hittite, and thus disagreed with Gordon's conclusion, he made an important contribution. Davis wished to see one continuum for a whole series of inscriptional material found on Crete. He believed that the Linear A tablets, the Phaistos Disc, and the much later Eteocretan material all represented the same language." (p. 39)

Eteocretan texts date ca. 500-300 BCE, suggesting Semitic speakers remained on Crete into late antiquity.

### 6. The Sea Peoples Migration

Gordon's reconstruction of Minoan history:

> "The Minoans were Semites who had migrated to Crete from somewhere in the Near East (perhaps from the Levant, perhaps from the Egyptian Delta) sometime during the Bronze Age. As the Bronze Age came to a close, they were pushed out of Crete by the increasing presence and power of the Mycenaean Greeks. The descendants of the people who wrote the Linear A tablets were part of the Sea Peoples movement (Philistines and others) who returned to the mainland, first attempting to attack Egypt, then settling on the Levantine coast." (p. 39)

## Defense Against Critics

### 1. The Expertise Gap

Rendsburg argues that classicist critics lacked the linguistic training to evaluate Gordon:

> "Those who rejected Gordon's position typically were scholars in the field of Classics with no training whatsoever in Semitic or other Near Eastern languages. The fact is that the average classicist knows Greek and Latin, but does not know any Semitic or other Near Eastern languages; whereas the average Semiticist knows not only various Semitic languages, but also Greek and perhaps other languages such as Latin, Hittite, Sumerian, Egyptian, and so on." (p. 40)

### 2. The "Snickering" Anecdote (George Bass)

> "The hostility goes deeper. I'm going to talk about this because we're too polite as scholars. I get very angry. Twenty years ago I sat next to a scholar who is an extremely well-known classical archaeologist—one of the best in the world—whose knowledge of Greek and German and any other language is pathetic... He was sitting next to me at a lecture by Cyrus Gordon, snickering all the way through. Of course he didn't understand it. But he'd been taught to snicker. It angered me." (Bass 1989:112, cited p. 40)

### 3. The Eblaite Parallel

The discovery of Eblaite demolishes the objection that Minoan has "inconsistent" Semitic isoglosses:

> "When this Semitic language first came to light in the 1970s, it was clear from the start that certain features of Eblaite showed an affinity with Akkadian, while at the same time other features of the language showed a close relationship with West Semitic. Scholars debated—and continue to debate—the position of Eblaite within Semitic, but no one denies that Eblaite is Semitic because it cannot be fitted neatly into our preexisting notions about the subdivisions of the language family." (p. 41)

David Owen's letter to Gordon (December 12, 1976):

> "Eblaite has those numerous intra-Semitic features that so often confuse us in Linear A. There is a regular š/s interchange! No need to look to Egyptian. There are both East and West Semitic features in the verbal system. In fact many of the criticisms of your decipherment by Semitists no longer will hold water in view of the Eblaite texts." (Gordon 1980:209 n. 20, cited p. 41)

### 4. Jan Best's Plagiarism

> "In 1972 Jan Best wrote of his acceptance of Gordon's decipherment of Minoan, calling Gordon the first and most ardent advocate of the Semitic identification of the language (Best 1972:13). Best continued to follow Gordon's work, but shortly thereafter... Best produced a series of works in which he presented himself as the decipherer of Minoan as Semitic, with no reference whatsoever to Gordon's prior work (Best 1982)." (p. 41)

Rendsburg's rebuke: "Such academic dishonesty required a strong reproof" (p. 41).

## Biblical Applications

### 1. Administrative List Parallels

The *ku-ro* "total" pattern in Minoan parallels biblical accounting:

> "Most striking is the parallel between the second half of Hagia Triada text 88 and the list of conquered kings in Joshua 12:1-24. Both texts present lists of individual items followed by the notation for 'one'; at the end of the list appears the word for 'all, total' and the total number of items." (p. 42)

This argues for the authenticity of the Joshua list as an early source, not a late addition.

### 2. Late Biblical Hebrew Syntax

Eteocretan *KA EΣ EΣ* parallels Hebrew *kol ʾîš waʾîš* "every man":

> "Avi Hurvitz earlier demonstrated that the *kol X u-X* syntagma was a feature of Late Biblical Hebrew. In my discussion of the evidence, I put forward the phrase *KA EΣ-Σ EΣ-Σ* (*koʾi išʾi*) attested in an Eteocretan inscription from ca. 500 BCE as an additional example of this usage." (p. 42)

### 3. The Name Element *ʾiš-*

> "In the above cited Eteocretan phrase, the word for 'man' is written *EΣ-Σ*, as opposed to the expected *Σ* (compare *Σ* 'city'). Here then we have a parallel to the initial element in the name *ʾĪšbaʿal* 'Esbaal' (1 Chronicles 8:33, 9:39), literally 'Man-of-Baal.'" (p. 42)

## The Old European Connection

Gordon's later view (1990s):

> "Gordon informs me that he accepts the view of Harold Haarmann (1990) and Marija Gimbutas (1991:308-21) that the Minoan Linear A script derives from the Old European script of the Danube valley of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic ages." (p. 42)

This suggests: Semites who arrived on Crete adopted an indigenous script for their Semitic language.

## Notable Passages

> "Loyalty to one's teacher no doubt played a role here, but an equally important factor is the training that Gordon's students received. Gordon's vast view of the ancient world, with sightlines reaching far beyond the norm, was transmitted to his students in the classroom. Thus, when they became scholars in their own right, they were in a unique position both to understand Gordon's approach and to accept his conclusions." (p. 40)

— Context: Why Gordon's students (not classicists) accepted his Minoan work.

> "Interestingly, this is almost forty years after his initial work in Minoan studies, Gordon continues to view the field as fertile ground for future discovery. There is much more to be done on the Linear A texts, the Phaistos Disk awaits interpretation... and the newly posited connection with the Old European script opens still further avenues. Sixty-five years after Gordon sailed past Crete on his first visit to the Near East, the inscriptions from the island continue to allure." (p. 42)

— Context: Gordon's continuing engagement with Minoan at age 87.
