## Overview

This opening chapter analyzes Genesis 1:1–2:3 as a masterpiece of literary composition. Rendsburg demonstrates how the ancient author employed repetition with variation, deliberate omissions, and careful avoidance of pagan deity names—all designed to be perceived aurally by an audience listening to oral performance.

**Central argument**: The first creation account is not a "simple tale" but reveals "deep literary sophistication" through linguistic and literary devices that a native Hebrew speaker would have recognized immediately.

## The *Tehom* Analysis

### Primordial Waters as Evil Force

Rendsburg's treatment of תְּהוֹם (*tehom*) in Genesis 1:2 directly supports the Tehom-Tiamat cosmogonic connection:

> "Water, in the form of the salt water that covers the surface of the earth, is seen as an evil force. After all, this salt water is of no use: one cannot drink it, one's animals will not drink it, and one cannot irrigate with it. In addition, the ocean is a potent force, which can wreck ships and destroy coastlines; most of us have witnessed the stormy sea and know its destructive power, and thus can understand why the ancients envisaged the watery mass in a negative light."
> — p. 18

### Cognate with Tiamat

Rendsburg explicitly connects Hebrew *tehom* to Babylonian *Tiamat*:

> "Note that Babylonian *tiamat* is cognate to Hebrew תְּהוֹם *təhom* 'deep, abyss', which, notwithstanding the lack of a feminine ending, is a feminine noun in Hebrew."
> — p. 18, n. 5

### Omission of "It Was Good" on Day Two

The deliberate absence of the phrase "God saw that it was good" (וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי־טוֹב) on Day Two—the day when the *raqia* (firmament) is created to bound the waters—reflects the negative valence of *tehom*:

> "God creates the רָקִיעַ *raqiaʿ* 'firmament', which serves to separate the waters above and the waters below. And while there is nothing inherently negative about this created element, since the waters were acted upon, so to speak (and note the fivefold use of the word מַיִם *mayim* 'water' in the three verses that comprise the description of day two), the author intentionally omits the declaration וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים כִּי טוֹב *wayyarʾ ʾɛlohim ki tob* 'and God saw that it was good' in his description of day two."
> — p. 18

## Avoidance of Pagan Deity Names

### Sun and Moon (Day Four)

Genesis 1:14-19 never uses the common nouns שֶׁמֶשׁ (*šemeš*) 'sun' or יָרֵחַ (*yareaḥ*) 'moon':

> "The reason is almost without a doubt due to a desire to avoid these words, because they evoke the names of pagan deities, worshipped in the local Canaanite culture as Shamash and Yarikh, the sun and moon deities, respectively, as known most importantly from the Ugaritic myths that feature both characters."
> — p. 22

Instead, the author uses circumlocutions:
- הַמָּאוֹר הַגָּדֹל (*ham-maʾor hag-gadol*) "the great light" = sun
- הַמָּאוֹר הַקָּטֹן (*ham-maʾor haq-qaṭon*) "the small light" = moon

### Sea (Day Three)

The plural יַמִּים (*yammim*) 'seas' is used rather than singular יָם (*yam*):

> "The answer to this enigma once more has to do with ancient deities, for Yamm was another member of the ancient Canaanite pantheon, the powerful sea-god who serves as an adversary to Baʿal. The author of Genesis 1, accordingly, opted for the plural form יַמִּים *yammim* 'seas'."
> — p. 24

### Sabbath (Day Seven)

Genesis 2:1-3 never uses the word שַׁבָּת (*šabbat*):

> "The answer is the same one offered above... for Shabbat (or Shabbatay) is the classical Hebrew word for the planet Saturn, which naturally was worshipped as a god by the ancients."
> — pp. 30-31

## Repetition with Variation

### The Vegetation Example (Genesis 1:11-12, 29)

Rendsburg presents the vegetation descriptions as a prime example of variation for variation's sake:

**Genesis 1:11 (command)**:
- עֵץ פְּרִי עֹשֶׂה פְּרִי לְמִינוֹ (*ʿeṣ pəri ʿośɛ pəri lə-mino*)
- "fruit trees that produce fruit (each) according to its kind"

**Genesis 1:12 (fulfillment)**:
- וְעֵץ עֹשֶׂה־פְּרִי (*wə-ʿeṣ ʿośɛ pəri*)
- "and trees that produce fruit"—shorter, with conjunction

**Genesis 1:29 (grant to humans)**:
- כָל־הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ פְרִי־עֵץ (*kol-ha-ʿeṣ ʾašɛr-bo pəri-ʿeṣ*)
- "all trees that have in it the fruit of the tree"—entirely different wording

> "The answer, to my mind, is simply variation for the sake of variation. A mind game, as it were, is present. The author, through the text that he created and the performer who presents the text orally, entertains his reader, who consumes the text aurally, as she listens attentively to the oral performance."
> — p. 20

### Morphological Variants

Even small morphological differences serve the variation principle:
- לְמִינוֹ (*lə-mino*) 'according to its kind' (standard form) — v. 11
- לְמִינֵהוּ (*lə-minehu*) 'according to its kind' (archaic form) — v. 12

## Oral Reading and Aural Processing

### Ancient Reading as Aural Experience

Rendsburg emphasizes that ancient reading was *heard*, not silently read:

> "For moderns, reading is largely a silent affair, a task performed by the eyes before the text is decoded and processed by the brain. For the ancients, however, reading was an aural experience: one *heard* the text before it was processed by the brain."
> — p. 26

### Augustine on Silent Reading

The rarity of silent reading is evidenced by Augustine's astonishment at Ambrose:

> "When he read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still... so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud."
> — Augustine, *Confessions* 6.3 (cited p. 28)

### Evidence from Hebrew

Two linguistic evidences for aural reading:

1. **The verb קרא (*q-r-ʾ*)** means both 'call aloud' (primary) and 'read' (derived)

2. **Isaiah 29:18**: וְשָׁמְעוּ בַיּוֹם־הַהוּא הַחֵרְשִׁים דִּבְרֵי־סֵפֶר
   "On that day the deaf shall *hear* the words of the book"

   > "In our contemporary society, where reading is mainly a visual activity, it is the blind who are handicapped... In ancient Israel, by contrast, where reading was largely an aural activity, the blind could 'read,' by *listening* to an oral presentation, whereas the deaf could not."
   > — p. 28

## The Somali Parallel

Rendsburg invokes contemporary Somali oral poetry to demonstrate how ancient audiences could process complex literary features:

> "Unaided by writing they learn long poems by heart and some have repertoires which are too great to be exhausted even by several evenings of continuous recitation. Moreover, some of them are endowed with such powers of memory that they can learn a poem by heart after hearing it only once."
> — B. W. Andrzejewski and I. M. Lewis, *Somali Poetry: An Introduction* (cited p. 24)

Audience correction of reciters:
> "Moreover, among the audience there are often people who already know by heart the particular poem, having learnt it from another source. Heated disputes sometimes arise between a reciter and his audience concerning the purity of his version."
> — p. 25

## Literary Structure of Genesis 1

| Day 1 | Light | ↔ | Day 4 | Lights (sun, moon, stars) |
|-------|-------|---|-------|---------------------------|
| Day 2 | Sky/Water | ↔ | Day 5 | Fish and Fowl |
| Day 3a | Dry Land | ↔ | Day 6a | Land Animals |
| Day 3b | Vegetation | ↔ | Day 6b | Humans |
| **Day 7** | **Sabbath** | | | (no parallel—unique) |

**Form follows content**:
> "God created an orderly universe; the author of Genesis 1 fashioned an orderly narrative."
> — p. 32

## The *Bə-reʾšit* Grammatical Anomaly

The opening words present a grammatical puzzle:

בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא (*bə-reʾšit baraʾ*) — lit. "in-the-beginning-of he-created"

> "The first word includes the preposition בְּ *bə-* 'in' plus a noun in the construct state, רֵאשִׁית *reʾšit* 'beginning (of)', which according to standard Hebrew grammatical rules... would demand another noun in the absolute state to follow. Instead, however, the second word in the text is a suffix-conjugation verb in the past tense, בָּרָא *baraʾ* 'he created'."
> — p. 16

**Rashi's parallel**: Hosea 1:2: תְּחִלַּת דִּבֶּר (*təḥillat dibbɛr*) "at the start of [Yhwh's] speaking"

The anomaly serves to signal: "The text she is to hear is not a simple text... but rather one in which challenging linguistic issues and literary formulations abound."
