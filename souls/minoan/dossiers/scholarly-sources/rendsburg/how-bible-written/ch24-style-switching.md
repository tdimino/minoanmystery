## Overview

This chapter explores how biblical authors "pepper their prose with Aramaic words, forms, and grammatical usages" when narratives are set in foreign lands or involve foreign characters. This technique—style-switching—creates linguistic atmosphere that transports the reader to an Aramean, Moabite, or other non-Israelite setting.

**Central argument**: Biblical authors deliberately introduced foreign dialectal features to evoke the setting of their narratives—a technique parallel to Shakespeare's use of French in *Henry V* or Chaucer's dialectal representation.

## Key Quotation

> "The storywriter peppers his prose with Aramaic words, forms, and grammatical usages, in order to evoke the Aramean atmosphere. By so doing, both the camera (as it were) and the language transport the reader to the land of Aram."
> — p. 503

## Primary Examples

### 1. Genesis 24 — Abraham's Servant in Aram-Naharaim

When Abraham's servant travels to Aram-Naharaim (Mesopotamia) to find a wife for Isaac, the narrative acquires Aramaic coloring:

**Aramaic features**:
- Vocabulary choices typical of Aramaic
- Grammatical constructions paralleling Aramaic syntax
- The setting (Aram-Naharaim) matches the linguistic features

### 2. Genesis 29-31 — Jacob in Laban's House

The Jacob-Laban narratives are set entirely in Paddan-Aram (Aramean territory). Rendsburg identifies extensive Aramaic-tinged Hebrew:

**Key passage**: Genesis 31:47 — The heap of witness

| Speaker | Language | Name Given |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Laban | Aramaic | יְגַר שָׂהֲדוּתָא (*Yegar Sahaduta*) |
| Jacob | Hebrew | גַּלְעֵד (*Gal'ed*) |

Both names mean "heap of witness," but Laban speaks in Aramaic while Jacob speaks in Hebrew—an explicit marker of linguistic differentiation within the narrative.

**Additional Aramaic features throughout Gen 29-31**:
- Lexical items with Aramaic cognates
- Morphological variants closer to Aramaic patterns
- Syntax echoing Aramaic constructions

### 3. The Balaam Oracles (Numbers 22-24)

Balaam is a Mesopotamian/Aramean seer hired by Moab's king. His oracles show dialectal features:

**Non-Israelite origins reflected in**:
- Vocabulary choices
- Poetic forms with Aramaic parallels
- The explicit identification of Balaam as coming "from Aram" (Num 23:7)

---

## Literary Parallels

Rendsburg draws comparisons to world literature:

### Shakespeare's *Henry V*

French dialogue appears when the setting shifts to France. English-speaking audiences understand the atmospheric function even without comprehending every French word.

### Chaucer's Dialectal Representation

*The Canterbury Tales* uses different dialects for characters of different regional origins—a medieval English parallel to biblical style-switching.

### Modern Film

Films set in foreign countries often include snippets of the local language for atmosphere, even when the main dialogue is in English.

## Linguistic Mechanism

### Aramaic-Hebrew Spectrum

Rather than treating Aramaic and Hebrew as sharply distinct languages, Rendsburg recognizes a continuum:

```
Pure Hebrew ←————————————————→ Pure Aramaic
         ↑                    ↑
    Standard BH          Aramaic texts
         ↑
    Style-switched passages
    (Hebrew with Aramaic coloring)
```

Northern Israelite Hebrew (Israelian Hebrew, Chapter 23) was already closer to Aramaic due to geographic proximity. Style-switching intensifies this coloring for narrative effect.

### Features of Style-Switched Hebrew

| Level | Example Features |
|-------|------------------|
| **Lexical** | Aramaic cognates instead of Hebrew equivalents |
| **Morphological** | Aramaic-type verb forms, noun patterns |
| **Syntactic** | Word order paralleling Aramaic |
| **Phonological** | Consonant values closer to Aramaic |

---

## The Audience's Reception

Rendsburg argues that ancient audiences would have recognized these features:

> "The ancient reader, meanwhile, no doubt would have understood."
> — (parallel formulation from Chapter 1)

Just as a modern reader recognizes when an author uses foreign words for atmosphere, ancient Hebrew speakers would have detected the Aramaic coloring and understood its narrative function.

---

## Implications for Textual Analysis

### Against Over-emendation

Passages with "anomalous" features may not be scribal errors but deliberate style-switching:

> "The free hand of the emender is the wrong approach here."
> — (from Chapter 8, applicable here)

### Dialect as Authorial Choice

What scholars sometimes attribute to different sources (J, E, P, D) may instead reflect authorial style-switching within unified compositions.

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Research

### The Cherethite-Levite Hypothesis

If Levites had Cretan/Cherethite origins, we might expect:

1. **Aegean linguistic coloring** in texts associated with Levitical traditions
2. **Maritime vocabulary** in priestly or cultic contexts
3. **Style-switching** when narratives involve Sea Peoples or Philistine settings

### Parallel Phenomena

Just as Hebrew authors used Aramaic for Mesopotamian settings, they might have used:
- **Philistine/Aegean coloring** for Philistine-set narratives
- **Egyptian coloring** for Exodus narratives
- **Canaanite archaisms** for patriarchal narratives

### Gordon's Broader Perspective

Cyrus Gordon's work on Ugaritic-Hebrew contact establishes precedent for recognizing Northwest Semitic dialectal interchange. Rendsburg (Gordon's student) extends this to internal Hebrew dialectal variation.
