## Overview

This chapter challenges the Documentary Hypothesis (JEDP theory), which proposes that the Torah was composed from four independent sources written over centuries and later combined by a redactor. Rendsburg argues instead for essential literary unity, with the stylistic variations that critics attribute to different sources actually reflecting deliberate authorial technique.

**Central argument**: The literary features discussed throughout *How the Bible is Written*—repetition with variation, style-switching, confused language—demonstrate unified authorship rather than composite redaction.

## The Documentary Hypothesis Summarized

The four hypothesized sources:

| Source | Traditional Date | Scope |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **J** (Yahwist) | 10th century BCE | Creation → Moses |
| **E** (Elohist) | 9th century BCE | Abraham → Moses |
| **D** (Deuteronomist) | 7th century BCE | Deuteronomy |
| **P** (Priestly) | 6th-5th century BCE | Creation → Moses (ritual focus) |

### Distinguishing Criteria

Source critics identify sources by:
1. **Divine name**: J uses יהוה (Yahweh); E/P use אלהים (Elohim)
2. **Vocabulary differences**: e.g., different terms for "maidservant"
3. **Theological emphases**: P focuses on ritual; D on law
4. **Duplicate narratives**: e.g., two creation accounts, two flood accounts
5. **Contradictions**: allegedly irreconcilable differences

## Rendsburg's Counter-Arguments

### 1. Repetition with Variation (Not Sources)

The "contradictions" and "duplications" that critics attribute to different sources are actually examples of repetition with variation—a deliberate literary technique:

> "At every turn [the author] introduced variation into his text, sometimes of very minor significance, sometimes of greater significance—but variation always."
> — (from Chapter 1)

**Example**: Genesis 1 vs. Genesis 2
- Not contradictory accounts from J and P
- Complementary perspectives with deliberate variation

### 2. Divine Name Variation (Not Source Markers)

The alternation between יהוה and אלהים serves literary and theological purposes:

| Name | Theological Valence |
|------|---------------------|
| **יהוה** (Yahweh) | Personal, covenantal, Israelite-specific |
| **אלהים** (Elohim) | Universal, cosmic, creator-deity aspect |

The author varies the divine name based on context, not because different sources used different names.

### 3. Style-Switching (Not Different Authors)

What critics see as different "voices" or "sources" may be:
- **Israelian Hebrew** features (northern dialect)
- **Style-switching** to evoke foreign settings (Aramaic coloring)
- **Register variation** for different narrative contexts

(See Chapters 23-24 for extensive treatment)

### 4. The Flood Narrative Test Case

The flood story (Genesis 6-9) is a classic source-critical test case. Critics divide it between J and P based on:
- Different divine names
- Different animal numbers (clean/unclean pairs vs. seven pairs)
- Duplicate commands

**Rendsburg's response**: Chapter 2 demonstrates extensive repetition with variation throughout the flood narrative. The animal terminology shifts deliberately (see detailed analysis in that chapter).

---

## Literary Unity Arguments

### Cross-Textual Connections

Rendsburg demonstrates literary connections spanning multiple "sources":
- Genesis 1-2 shows unified design
- The Judah-Tamar story (Gen 38) connects to surrounding Joseph narrative
- Vocabulary and motifs recur across supposed source boundaries

### The David-Genesis Connection

If Genesis was composed in the tenth century to reflect David's reign (Chapter 21), the entire narrative has unified purpose:
- Monarchy anticipation
- Jerusalem sanctification
- Judah prominence
- Younger son motif

These themes pervade all "sources," suggesting unified authorship.

### Oral-Written Interface

The dual transmission process (written + oral) explains some textual variations:
- Scribes copied written manuscripts
- Oral tradents preserved performance traditions
- Minor variations accumulated through parallel transmission

---

## Implications for Biblical Scholarship

### Against Over-Division

> "The free hand of the emender is the wrong approach here."
> — (from Chapter 8)

Similarly, the free hand of the source divider misses the literary artistry of the unified text.

### Literary Approach Priority

Rendsburg advocates reading the text as literature first:
1. Recognize literary techniques (repetition, variation, wordplay)
2. Understand oral/aural context
3. Then assess compositional questions

### Not Denying All Complexity

Rendsburg acknowledges:
- The Bible spans centuries of composition (Song of the Sea to Daniel)
- Later editorial work occurred
- Textual variants exist

But the core narrative (Genesis through Kings) shows literary unity consistent with tenth-century composition.

## Relationship to Other Scholarship

### Whybray's Critique

R. N. Whybray's *The Making of the Pentateuch* (1987) similarly challenged the Documentary Hypothesis on methodological grounds.

### Cassuto's Literary Analysis

Umberto Cassuto (*The Documentary Hypothesis*, 1941) demonstrated literary explanations for features attributed to sources.

### Modern Literary Approaches

Robert Alter, Meir Sternberg, and others have shown how literary analysis better explains textual features than source division.

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Research

### Unified Composition Implications

If the Torah represents unified tenth-century composition:

1. **Cultural context is singular**: The Davidic court, with its Cherethite connections, is the compositional setting
2. **Cretan influences** could have entered through one generation of authors
3. **Mediterranean connections** (Phoenician, Aegean) reflect contemporary contact

### Against Late Dating of "P"

Many source critics date P (Priestly source) to post-exilic period. If Rendsburg is correct:
- Priestly material is also tenth-century
- Tabernacle/Temple descriptions reflect Solomonic construction
- Levitical traditions are early, not late

This supports the Levite-Cretan hypothesis, which assumes early Levitical traditions.

## Key Quotation

On the Documentary Hypothesis approach:

> "Anyone familiar with the Documentary Hypothesis... will recognize at once that my approach to the problem is totally different. Actually, it is different on two levels. First, the Documentary Hypothesis proposes that the Torah is comprised of four major sources, which were all written independently and then combined by a redactor at a later stage to create the canonical text. Second, these sources are hypothesized to span centuries... so that they supposedly existed as independent texts for a relatively long period of time before they were combined into a single final product."
