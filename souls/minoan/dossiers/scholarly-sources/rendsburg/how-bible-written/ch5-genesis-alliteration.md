## Overview

Chapter 5 introduces alliteration as a key building block of biblical prose and demonstrates its extensive use in Genesis. Rendsburg establishes the methodology for identifying alliterative patterns in Hebrew—including the use of identical and similar consonants, *hapax legomena*, and cognates from Ugaritic and other Semitic languages—providing the foundation for subsequent analysis of alliteration throughout the Bible.

## Core Methodological Statement

> "The very word 'alliteration' typically conjures up notions of poetry, and as we shall see in a moment, alliteration is a feature of biblical poetry as well. Less widely recognized, however, is the manner in which alliteration functions within biblical prose—and it is this subject, after some introductory thoughts and explanations, that will dominate both this chapter and the following one."

## Hebrew Alliteration: Key Principles

### 1. Root Structure and Flexibility

> "Given the root structure of Hebrew (and Semitic languages generally), the repeated sounds are not found at the beginning of words necessarily, but rather, they (a) may appear anywhere within a given word or words, and (b) may be accompanied by other like-sounding consonants."

### 2. Permutations and Combinations

Alliteration in Hebrew operates with:
- Two or three identical consonants
- Two or three similar consonants
- Any combination thereof
- Sounds in same order or scrambled (anagrammatic)
- Effect placed in same verse or adjacent verses
- Either highlighting two crucial words or creating a cluster

### 3. Phonological Alignments for Alliteration

| Category | Consonants | Basis |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Voiced/Voiceless pairs | /b/-/p/, /z/-/s/, /d/-/t/ | Same articulation, different voicing |
| Sonorants | /m/, /n/, /r/, /l/ | Liquids and nasals interchange |
| Dentals | /d/, /t/, /ṭ/ | Same point of articulation |
| Velars | /g/, /k/, /q/ | Same point of articulation |
| Gutturals (Pharyngeal) | /ḥ/, /ʿ/ | Pharyngeal fricatives |
| Gutturals (Laryngeal) | /h/, /ʾ/ | Laryngeal sounds |
| Sibilants | /s/, /z/, /ṣ/, /š/, /ś/ | Lateral /ś/ connects both to /l/ and sibilants |

## Paradigmatic Example: Psalm 55:9

> מֵרוּחַ סֹעָה מִסָּעַר
> *me-ruaḥ soʿa mis-saʿar*
> "From the wind, sweeping from the storm."

**Analysis**:
- Identical sounds: /m/ and /r/ in מֵרוּחַ and מִסָּעַר
- Identical sounds: /s/ and /ʿ/ in סֹעָה and מִסָּעַר
- Similar sounds: /ḥ/ (pharyngeal) in רוּחַ echoes /ʿ/ (also pharyngeal) in the other words
- *Hapax legomenon*: סֹעָה *soʿa* 'sweeping' occurs only here
- Onomatopoeia: The two *samekh*s create the sound of wind whistling

> "As we shall see time and again, rare words, including *hapax legomena*, were specifically chosen by the writers to create or enhance soundplay."

## Key Genesis Examples

### 1. Genesis 2:25–3:1 — Naked/Cunning

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| עֲרוּמִּים *ʿarummim* | ʿarummim | 'naked' (2:25) |
| עָרוּם *ʿarum* | ʿarum | 'cunning' (3:1) |

The wordplay connects the innocence of the naked couple with the cunning serpent.

### 2. Genesis 6:14 — Gopher-Wood and Pitch

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| גֹּפֶר *gopɛr* | gopɛr | g-p-r | 'gopher-wood' |
| וְכָפַרְתָּ *wəkaparta* | wə-kaparta | k-p-r | 'you shall cover' |
| בַּכֹּפֶר *bak-kopɛr* | bak-kopɛr | k-p-r | 'with pitch' |

> "Clearly, the author of our text reached deep into the Hebrew lexicon to purposefully select these words, one with the consonants *g-p-r* and two with the consonants *k-p-r*, to alliterate with each other."

**Cognate Evidence**: Hebrew כֹּפֶר *kopɛr* 'pitch' is cognate with Akkadian *kupru* 'pitch' in the Gilgamesh flood narrative (Tablet XI, line 55).

### 3. Genesis 21:4, 7–8 — Circumcision and Weaning

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| וַיָּמָל *wayyamol* | wayyamol | m-w-l | 'he circumcised' |
| מִלֵּל *millel* | millel | m-l-l | 'declare' |
| וַיִּגָּמַל *wayyiggamal* | wayyiggamal | g-m-l | 'he was weaned' |
| הִגָּמֵל *higgamel* | higgamel | g-m-l | 'the weaning' |

> "The verb מִלֵּל *millel* 'declare' in v. 7 is a rare verb, one totally unexpected in the mouth of Sarah within the larger narrative. Apart from Gen 21:7, the verb is limited to poetry in the Bible."

**Rashi's Observation**: Medieval commentator noted the *gematria* of מִלֵּל (*mem-lamed-lamed*) equals 100, Abraham's age at Isaac's birth—demonstrating the passage's unusual vocabulary triggered exegetical attention.

### 4. Genesis 24:18–22 — Gazing at the Well

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| שְׁתֵה *šəte* | šəte | š-t-h | 'drink' |
| וַתִּשְׁאַב *wattišʾab* | wattišʾab | š-ʾ-b | 'she drew' |
| מִשְׁתָּאֵה *mištaʾe* | mištaʾe | š-ʾ-h | 'is gazing' |

> "This passage provides a paradigmatic example of the employment of a *hapax legomenon* in order to produce alliteration. The unique word is מִשְׁתָּאֵה *mištaʾe* 'is gazing' in v. 21."

### 5. Genesis 25:23–24 — Twins and Nations

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| לְאֹם *ləʾom* | ləʾom | l-ʾ-m | 'people' (3x) |
| וַיִּמְלְאוּ *wayyimləʾu* | wayyimləʾu | m-l-ʾ | 'were fulfilled' |

> "The root of this common verb, מ-ל-א *m-l-ʾ* 'fill', constitutes an anagram of the noun לְאֹם *ləʾom* 'people', with the alliteration heard clearly."

**Poetic Vocabulary**: לְאֹם *ləʾom* 'people' occurs 31x in the Bible, 27 in poetry—its use here in prose is deliberate for alliterative effect.

### 6. Genesis 32:30, 33 — Jacob at the Jabbok

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| הַגִּידָה *haggida* | haggida | 'tell' |
| גִּיד הַנָּשֶׁה *gid han-našɛ* | gid han-našɛ | 'the male sinew' |

**Stanley Gevirtz's Observation**: The phrase גִּיד הַנָּשֶׁה also contains echoes of the tribal names גָּד *gad* 'Gad' and מְנַשֶּׁה *mənašše* 'Manasseh'—the Jabbok River serves as the boundary between their territories.

### 7. Genesis 2:15–18 — Lady as His Opposite

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| בְּגַן־עֵדֶן *bə-gan ʿedɛn* | bə-gan ʿedɛn | 'in the garden of Eden' |
| עֵץ הַגָּן *ʿeṣ hag-gan* | ʿeṣ hag-gan | 'trees of the garden' |
| עֵזֶר כְּנֶגְדּוֹ *ʿezɛr kə-nɛgdo* | ʿezɛr kə-nɛgdo | 'a lady as his opposite' |

**Ben-Ḥayyim's Proposal**: The word עֵזֶר *ʿezɛr* here does NOT mean 'help' but is cognate with Arabic عذراء *ʿaḏrā* 'virgin, young woman'—a homonym selected for alliterative effect with /ʿ/, /n/, /g/, /d/ sounds in the garden descriptions.

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Thesis

### 1. Ugaritic and Akkadian Cognates

Rendsburg consistently invokes cognate evidence from Ugaritic and Akkadian to explain rare Hebrew vocabulary:
- כֹּפֶר *kopɛr* 'pitch' ← Akkadian *kupru* (Gilgamesh flood)
- This methodology supports tracing Semitic-Aegean etymological connections

### 2. Rare Words as Deliberate Choice

> "Rare words frequently are invoked *alliterationis causa*."

This principle applies to understanding:
- Foreign loanwords in biblical texts (Caphtorian terminology)
- Preserved technical vocabulary (priestly terms)
- Deliberate archaisms (liturgical language)

### 3. Oral-Aural Processing

> "One stellar example from American history demonstrates the point nicely... 'Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent'... The brilliance of Lincoln's address... lies not only in its stirring content, but in the manner of elocution that captures the audience from the start."

This oral performance context parallels:
- The Palaikastro Hymn's recitation
- Mediterranean ritual formulas
- Kouretic choral traditions

### 4. Sophisticated Literary Craftsmen

> "The ancient Hebrew wordsmiths made effective use of the technique, spicing their compositions with alliteration when so desired in an effort to further enhance the reading (again, better: listening) pleasure."

This supports the thesis that biblical authors:
- Could preserve foreign terminology precisely
- Employed wordplay on foreign names (cf. Cherethite-Cretan *k-r-t*)
- Transmitted sophisticated cultural memories
