## Overview

This chapter demonstrates how biblical authors used syntactically confused language as a deliberate literary device to portray confusion, excitement, or bewilderment. Rather than scribal errors requiring emendation, these "problematic" passages are intentional artistic choices—form following content.

**Central argument**: "In all these instances, I propose that we view the confused language as a deliberate literary device invoked to portray confusion, excitement, or bewilderment."

## The Egyptian Paradigm: *The Shipwrecked Sailor*

Rendsburg begins with an Egyptian parallel to establish the cross-cultural pattern.

### Lines 36-37 (= 105-106)

The Shipwrecked Sailor narrative contains a famously difficult passage: *in ḫt ḥwi n-i s(y)* — lit. "by wood, struck, to me, it"

Scholarly attempts to translate this passage all acknowledge its difficulty:

| Scholar | Translation | Comment |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Adolf Erman | "It was a piece of wood that... it to me" | "The whole account of the storm is unintelligible to us" |
| W. K. Simpson | "There was a plank which struck it (the wave) for me" | "This passage difficult in the original" |
| Miriam Lichtheim | "The mast—it (the wave) struck (it)" | "This admittedly imperfect solution..." |

**Rendsburg's interpretation**:

> "But the difficulty and unintelligibility of this passage are precisely the point. I propose that we view these words from the mouth of the Sailor as a clever literary device in which confused syntax is utilized to portray the confusion that characterized the moment. A ship is in danger at sea, the wind is howling, and an eight-foot wave strikes the ship."
> — p. 131

## Biblical Examples

### 1. 1 Samuel 9:12-13 — The Maidens Answer Saul

When Saul asks three words (הֲיֵשׁ בָּזֶה הָרֹאֶה "is the seer here?"), the maidens respond with a two-verse rambling answer.

**Avi Hurvitz's analysis** (cited by Rendsburg):

> "If we judge the quality of the style employed in the passage solely according to strict formal linguistic standards of grammar and syntax, we would undoubtedly conclude that this is deficient Hebrew. However, if we consider the peculiar circumstances of the episode, it becomes clear that the confused speech created here by the biblical writer is an attempt to reproduce the effect of the girls all talking at once in their excitement at meeting Saul."
> — p. 134

**Martin Buber's term**: "Mädchenschwatz" (girls' prattle)

### 2. Ruth 2:7 — The Foreman Answers Boaz

זֶה שִׁבְתָּהּ הַבַּיִת מְעָט — lit. "this, her sitting (in) the house, a little"

This famously difficult phrase has generated extensive secondary literature. Rendsburg argues the foreman speaks "in an apologetic and confused manner because he is not sure whether the 'boss' will approve" of his decision to let Ruth rest inside.

> "The awkward formulation of the overseer's words... should not be considered a textual corruption created by a *later copyist*, but, rather, an artistic device deliberately employed for dramatic purposes by the *original author* of Ruth."
> — p. 137

### 3. Genesis 19:12 — Who is in Lot's House?

עֹד מִי־לְךָ פֹה חָתָן וּבָנֶיךָ וּבְנֹתֶיךָ

The visitors lead with חָתָן (*ḥatan*) "son-in-law" (singular, without possessive) before "your sons and your daughters"—an unexpected ordering.

> "Too much action is happening all at once to allow the visitors (even angelic ones) to compose a coherent sentence/question. The words roll off the tongue, even if they lack perfect sense."
> — p. 140

Contrast with Genesis 19:15 the next morning, where the same visitors speak with "greater composure": קוּם קַח אֶת־אִשְׁתְּךָ וְאֶת־שְׁתֵּי בְנֹתֶיךָ — "arise, take your wife and your two daughters"—grammatical and straightforward.

### 4. Genesis 37:28 — Joseph Pulled from the Pit

וַיַּעַבְרוּ אֲנָשִׁים מִדְיָנִים סֹחֲרִים וַיִּמְשְׁכוּ וַיַּעֲלוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף מִן־הַבּוֹר וַיִּמְכְּרוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִים

**The ambiguity**: Who pulled Joseph? Who sold him? Midianites or brothers?

Rendsburg argues this reflects Joseph's point of view:

> "Joseph is at the bottom of a pit, unable to see what transpires above, and catching only a few sounds and voices here and there. He cannot put all the clues together, and thus for Joseph the events transpiring above are unclear."
> — p. 146

The threefold mention of "Joseph" (rather than pronominal "him") marks each clause as potentially having a different subject.

### 5. Genesis 37:30 — Reuben's Impossible Syntax

וַאֲנִי אָנָה אֲנִי־בָא — "and I, to where shall I *come*?"

The verb בוא (*b-w-ʾ*) 'come' is syntactically impossible with the interrogative אָנָה 'to where'. Standard Hebrew requires הלך (*h-l-k*) 'go':

> "In questions asking for the destination to which a person is moving, the verb 'to go' is compulsory, because using 'to come' equals assuming that the destination is already known."
> — Leo Depuydt (cited p. 147)

**Rendsburg's explanation**: "Reuben, in a fretful state and with no knowledge of what has become of Joseph, can barely speak."

### 6. Joshua 2:4 — Rahab Hides "Him"

וַתִּקַּח הָאִשָּׁה אֶת־שְׁנֵי הָאֲנָשִׁים וַתִּצְפְּנוֹ

The verb is singular: "and she hid *him*" (not "them") despite two spies being hidden.

> "I would argue that the author used the third masc. sg. pronominal suffix intentionally, to indicate that Rahab—who in reality had no time to hide either man—astonishingly managed to hide at least one of the men."
> — p. 154

Additionally, the form וַתִּצְפְּנוֹ uses the rare suffix ־וֹ rather than expected ־ֵהוּ (only 3-4 examples in entire Bible vs. 287 cases of the standard form).

### 7. Judges 18:14-20 — The Ransacking at Micah's House

The four cult objects appear in different orders across the narrative:

| Verse | Order | Condition |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| v. 14 | ephod, teraphim, idol, molten-image | Normal pairings |
| v. 17 | idol, ephod, teraphim, molten-image | Abnormal pairings |
| v. 18 | "idol *of the* ephod", teraphim, molten-image | Impossible construct |
| v. 20 | ephod, teraphim, idol | One item missing |

> "The cumulative effect of the four phrases—beginning with the normal pairings in v. 14, then creating abnormal pairings in v. 17, then positing an impossible construction in v. 18, and finally omitting one item in v. 20—is to portray the confusion that reigned in Micah's house."
> — p. 161

### 8. 1 Samuel 14:21 — Confusion in the Philistine Camp

The narrator describes a "very great confusion" (מְהוּמָה גְדוֹלָה מְאֹד) among the Philistines. The subsequent verse (v. 21) is nearly untranslatable:

> "The verse is intentionally confused: it depicts the confusion that reigned in the Philistine camp. Any attempt either to emend the Hebrew original or to smooth over its difficulties in a modern translation misses the point entirely."
> — p. 166

## Methodology: Form Follows Content

Rendsburg articulates the general principle:

> "The rules of grammar are not laws of nature... Ungrammaticality, or deviant grammar, is often a mark in that it draws our attention to something special, as readers of modern poetry well know. Therefore the object of our interest must be the deviation as well as the rule."
> — Nick Veldhuis (cited p. 131)

---

## Translation Approaches

Rendsburg critiques translations that smooth over difficulties:

**Joshua 2:4** — All English translations render "she hid *them*" despite Hebrew "she hid *him*"

**Judges 18:18** — NJPS and REB rearrange the word order to restore "normal" pairings (with footnote acknowledging literal Hebrew)

**1 Samuel 14:21** — NRSV adds words and changes syntax to create smooth narrative

> "The free hand of the emender is the wrong approach here."
> — p. 166

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Research

This chapter demonstrates:

1. **Sophisticated ancient authorship**: Biblical authors were not primitive storytellers but sophisticated literary craftsmen
2. **Form-content unity**: Linguistic features encode meaning beyond the lexical
3. **Cross-cultural patterns**: The Egyptian parallel shows this is a Mediterranean literary technique
4. **Caution against emendation**: Difficult passages may preserve authorial intent
