## Overview

Chapter 25 documents how Hebrew prophets incorporated **foreign linguistic features** into their oracles against foreign nations. This technique — termed "addressee-switching" — demonstrates that biblical authors were aware of and deliberately represented the speech patterns of neighboring peoples including Arameans, Moabites, Edomites, Phoenicians, Akkadians, and by extension, Aegean peoples (through Philistine-Cherethite references).

## Definition: Addressee-Switching

Rendsburg defines the technique:

> "The term addressee-switching refers to the manner in which **the prophets pepper their oracles to the foreign nations with linguistic traits indicative of the speech variety of the nation being addressed**."

The literary effect:

> "although the people who actually heard these speeches were the Israelites themselves, the addition of such foreign linguistic elements no doubt added a veneer of reality and authenticity to the prophetic pronouncements."

### Prophetic Oracles to the Nations

Addressee-switching appears in:
- **Amos** (chapter 1)
- **Isaiah** (chapters 13–23)
- **Zephaniah** (chapter 2)
- **Jeremiah** (chapters 46–51)
- **Obadiah** (most of chapter 1)
- **Ezekiel** (chapters 25–32)

## Discovery: Chaim Rabin

The technique was first identified by Chaim Rabin:

> "It is a feature of First Isaiah's style that, when speaking of or addressing a foreign nation, he creates 'atmosphere' by using some word or words in that nation's language. Of course such phrases must not be expected to be correct expressions in the foreign language in all respects. Over-correctness in such 'stage' use of a foreign language would defeat its purpose. **The point is to give the listener some feature which strongly suggests the other language, but which is sufficiently familiar to be understood.**"

## Examples by Target Nation

### 1. Isaiah 21:11–12 — Oracle to Dumah (Arabia)

Features evoking Ancient North Arabian/Aramaic:
- Verbal roots ב-ע-י *b-ʿ-y* and א-ת-י *ʾ-t-y* (variant forms)
- Retention of root letter *yod* in verb forms: תִּבְעָיוּן *tibʿayun*, בְּעָיוּ *bəʿayu*, אֵתָיוּ *ʾetayu*

### 2. Isaiah 17:12 — Oracle to Aram/Damascus

Two Aramaic features:
- יֶהֱמָיוּן *yɛhɛmayun* 'they roar' — with consonant *yod* retained
- כַּבִּירִים *kabbirim* 'great, mighty' — common in Aramaic, limited in Hebrew to style/addressee-switching

### 3. Isaiah 23:13 — Oracle to Phoenicia (Tyre/Sidon)

> זֶה הָעָם *zɛ ha-ʿam* — "this people"

Non-standard Hebrew syntax evoking Phoenician/Aramaic grammatical pattern. Standard Hebrew would be הָעָם הַזֶּה *ha-ʿam haz-zɛ*.

### 4. Jeremiah 48:36 — Oracle to Moab

> יִתְרַת *yitrat* 'gain, riches, abundance'

Feminine singular noun retaining the *-at* ending "precisely as occurs in Moabite."

### 5. Jeremiah 50:15 — Oracle to Babylon

> אָשְׁיֹותֶיָה *ʾošyotɛha* 'her towers'

A *hapax legomenon* evoking Akkadian *asītu* 'tower' — deliberately chosen for the Babylonian oracle.

### 6. Ezekiel 26:11 — Oracle to Tyre

> מַצְּבֹת *maṣṣəbot* 'pillar'

Uses Phoenician feminine singular ending *-ot* (standard Hebrew would be מַצֵּבָה *maṣṣeba*). The singular verb confirms this is not a plural form.

### 7. Amos 1:5 — Oracle to Aram

> וְתֹומֵךְ שֵׁבֶט *wə-tomek šebɛṭ* — "he who holds the scepter"

Hebrew interdialectal equivalent of Aramaic phrase יאחז חטר *yʾḤz ḤṬr* 'he who holds the scepter' (attested in Panamuwa inscription).

### 8. Zechariah 9:3 — Oracle to Tyre

> וְחָרוּץ *ḥaruṣ* 'gold'

Uses Phoenician/Ugaritic term for gold instead of standard Hebrew זָהָב *zahab*. "The word חרץ ḤrṢ 'gold' is the only term attested for this precious metal in Phoenician."

### 9. Jeremiah 49:11 — Oracle to Edom

> תִּבְטָחוּ *tibṭaḥu* 'trust' (3rd fem. pl.)

"The only third fem. pl. *tiqtəlū* form in the Bible" — likely reflecting Edomite morphology.

## Relationship to Style-Switching

Addressee-switching is closely related to **style-switching** (Chapter 24), where authors use dialectal features to evoke foreign settings within narrative:

> "addressee-switching is closely related to the technique of style-switching that was surveyed in the previous chapter."

Both techniques demonstrate:
1. Biblical authors' awareness of surrounding languages/dialects
2. Deliberate literary craftsmanship
3. Audience expectation of linguistic authenticity

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Thesis

### Aegean/Cretan Awareness

The prophetic oracles against Philistines (Amos 1:8, Jer 47:4, Ezek 25:16, Zech 9:6) use the *k-r-t* wordplay documented in Chapter 18, which presupposes:

1. **Knowledge of Philistine Aegean origins** — The wordplay only works if audiences know Cherethites = Cretans
2. **Sustained cultural memory** — Multiple prophets across centuries exploit the same connection
3. **Linguistic sophistication** — Authors expected audiences to recognize foreign language markers

### Implications for Foreign Cultural Transmission

If biblical authors could:
- Incorporate Aramaic, Phoenician, Moabite, Edomite, and Akkadian features
- Expect audiences to recognize these as "foreign atmosphere"
- Preserve Aegean-origin terminology (Cherethite/Cretan)

Then **Aegean religious concepts could similarly have been transmitted and recognized** as foreign-but-familiar elements within Israelite tradition.

### The Philistine-Cherethite-Cretan Chain

The addressee-switching chapters (25) combined with wordplay analysis (Chapter 18) establish:

| Term | Origin | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| כַּפְתּוֹר *kaptor* | Toponym | Caphtor = Crete/Aegean |
| כְּרֵתִי *kəreti* | Gentilic | Cherethite = Cretan |
| פְּלִשְׁתִּים *pəlištim* | Gentilic | Philistines (from Caphtor) |
| כ-ר-ת *k-r-t* | Verbal root | "cut off, destroy" |

The prophets exploit the phonetic coincidence of *kəreti* (Cretan) and *hikratti* (I will cut off) — demonstrating both awareness of origins and literary sophistication.

## Methodology: "Stage Language"

Rabin's insight that foreign features need only "suggest the other language" rather than be grammatically correct parallels how:

1. **Shakespeare** uses French in *Henry V*
2. **Chaucer** represents dialects
3. **Modern films** use accented speech for foreign characters

The technique is **impressionistic**, not documentary — creating atmosphere rather than transcription.
