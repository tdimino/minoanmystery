## Overview

This chapter argues for a tenth-century BCE dating of Genesis (and much of the Torah), composed during the reigns of David and Solomon. Rendsburg contends that the book embeds anticipations of monarchic Israel into patriarchal narratives—a technique of "telling the story about the past, but reflecting upon the present."

**Central argument**: "Write a national epic incorporating all of the earlier traditions back to Abraham, and embed into that narrative anticipations of the present. That is to say, there is a social, religious, and indeed political message in the book of Genesis."

## Dating Evidence: Three Key Arguments

### 1. The Promise of Kings (Gen 17:6, 16)

> וּמְלָכִים מִמְּךָ יֵצֵאוּ "and kings will come-forth from you" (Gen 17:6)
> מַלְכֵי עַמִּים מִמֶּנָּה יִהְיוּ "kings of peoples will be from her" (Gen 17:16)

**Rendsburg's argument**:
> "The issue of monarchy, as indicated above, was a public concern during the late eleventh century and the first half of the tenth century (or perhaps a bit longer, if there was any lingering resistance), but at no other time. In the earlier period there still was a strong opposition to kingship; while after the time of David and Solomon monarchy was a reality from which there was no turning back."
> — p. 450

### 2. The Boundaries (Gen 15:18)

> אֶת־הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת מִנְּהַר מִצְרַיִם עַד־הַנָּהָר הַגָּדֹל נְהַר־פְּרָת
> "this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River"

**Rendsburg's argument**:
> "The boundaries... match the extent of the Davidic-Solomonic empire. At an earlier time an Israelite could only have laughed at such an idea... and after the death of Solomon the empire collapsed, never again to be realized."
> — p. 451

### 3. The Prominence of Judah

Jacob's blessing (Gen 49:10) and Judah's noble role in the Joseph story reflect Davidic dynasty promotion:

> לֹא־יָסוּר שֵׁבֶט מִיהוּדָה וּמְחֹקֵק מִבֵּין רַגְלָיו
> "the staff shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler from between his legs"

## Literary Parallels: Telling Past, Reflecting Present

Rendsburg invokes world literature parallels:

| Work | Past Narrated | Present Reflected |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Arthur Miller's *The Crucible* | Salem witch trials (1692) | McCarthyism (1950s) |
| *M\*A\*S\*H* (film/series) | Korean War (1950s) | Vietnam War (1970s) |
| Verdi's *Nabucco* | Babylonian exile (6th c. BCE) | Habsburg rule over Italy (1840s) |
| Shakespeare's histories | Plantagenet kings | Tudor monarchy |

> "Elizabeth is reported to have said to the Keeper of the Tower, 'I am Richard II, know ye not that?'"
> — p. 467

**Rendsburg's application**:
> "And thus I envision David turning to Benaiah, the captain of his personal bodyguard, after a reading of Genesis 38... and saying, אֲנִי יְהוּדָה הֲלֹא תֵדַע *ʾani yəhuda haloʾ tedaʿ* 'I am Judah, know ye not that?'"
> — p. 467

## Jerusalem in Genesis

Three passages anticipate Jerusalem's centrality:

### 1. Melchizedek (Gen 14:18)

מַלְכִּי־צֶדֶק מֶלֶךְ שָׁלֵם — "Melchizedek, king of Salem"

Salem = shortened form of Jerusalem. Melchizedek is both king and כֹּהֵן לְאֵל עֶלְיוֹן "priest to El Elyon"—reflecting the dual role of Canaanite city-state rulers.

**Connection to Zadok**: Both names share the root צ-ד-ק (*ṣ-d-q*) 'righteous'. The message: Abraham tithed to Melchizedek, so too should Israelites tithe to Zadok (the former Jebusite priest whom David retained).

### 2. Mount Moriah (Gen 22:14)

הַר יְהוָה — "the mount of Yhwh"

> "The listener to this story would hear the very sounds of יְרוּשָׁלַיִם *yərušalayim* 'Jerusalem' at this crucial moment in the text."
> — p. 458

The wordplay: יִרְאֶה (*yirʾɛ*) 'will see' and יֵרָאֶה (*yeraʾɛ*) 'is seen'—both beginning with י-ר (*y-r*), evoking ירושלים.

### 3. The Gihon River (Gen 2:13)

The Gihon as one of Eden's four rivers—also the name of Jerusalem's primary spring.

> "We are dealing here with the transfiguration of a myth... that has the great life-giving water sources of the world flowing together, including the main water source of Jerusalem."
> — p. 459

## David-Genesis Connections

| Genesis Figure/Motif | David/Samuel Parallel |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Younger son favored (Isaac, Jacob, Joseph) | David youngest son of Jesse (1 Sam 16) |
| Fraternal strife (Cain-Abel, Jacob-Esau) | Amnon-Absalom, Adonijah-Solomon |
| Judah sins with Tamar (Gen 38) | David sins with Bathsheba (2 Sam 11-12) |
| בַּת־שׁוּעַ "daughter of Shua" (Gen 38:2) | בַּת־שֶׁבַע "Bathsheba" (2 Sam 11:3) |
| Adullam (Gen 38:1) | Adullam (1 Sam 22:1) |
| Mahanaim (Gen 32:3) | Mahanaim (2 Sam 17:24) |

## The Invention of Prose Narrative

### The Dichotomy

| | Ugarit | Israel |
|---|--------|--------|
| **Deity** | Baʿal et al. | Yahweh |
| **Manifestation** | nature | history |
| **Mode** | poetry | prose |

### Why Prose?

> "The poetic tradition of the ancient Near East... was too heavily laden with the polytheistic mythologies of Israel's neighbors... Israel's writers simply could not countenance utilizing that medium for expressing their revolutionary ideas about the divine."
> — p. 474

### Egyptian Influence

Egyptian adventure tales (Sinuhe, Wenamun, Shipwrecked Sailor) are prose and "devoid of overriding theological messages." They served as the model for Hebrew prose narrative.

## The *Nostos* Theme

The homecoming motif appears across ancient literature:

| Text | Hero |
|------|------|
| *Gilgamesh* | Gilgamesh |
| *Odyssey* | Odysseus |
| *Sinuhe* | Sinuhe |
| Jacob narrative | Jacob (20 years in Aram = 20 years Odysseus away from Ithaca?) |
| **Exodus-Joshua** | **The people of Israel** (collective) |

> "The Bible goes beyond all these narratives, with their focus on a single hero figure, by adapting the homecoming motif to the major story that dominates the Torah and the following book of Joshua... the journey is Israel's, not Moses's."
> — p. 476

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Research

### Early Composition Implications

If Genesis dates to the tenth century BCE:
1. **Cultural contact** with Aegean/Phoenician world was contemporary
2. **Sea Peoples settlement** (Cherethites, Philistines) was recent memory
3. **Levite-Cretan traditions** could have entered during Davidic composition

### The Egyptian Connection

Rendsburg's emphasis on Egyptian prose influence aligns with:
- Moses tradition set in Egypt
- Possible transmission of Aegean traditions via Nile Delta
- Phoenician-Egyptian-Israelite cultural networks

### Jerusalem's Sanctification

The embedding of Jerusalem into Genesis parallels:
- The absorption of Jebusite/Canaanite religious elements
- Possible integration of Cretan-derived cult practices via Cherethites
- Zadok as mediating figure between Jebusite and Yahwistic traditions
