## Overview

Chapter 3 demonstrates the literary technique of *polyprosopon* ("many faces") through detailed analysis of the Exodus plagues narrative. Rendsburg shows how the biblical author systematically varies formulaic expressions — particularly the warnings to Pharaoh and the "hardening of heart" motif — to create literary artistry while maintaining narrative unity.

---

## Key Concept: *Polyprosopon*

The term was coined by Scott Noegel:

> "based on the Greek words for 'many' and 'face'. Which is to say, the authors strived to present their language with 'many faces', never (or hardly ever) repeating the same expression in verbatim fashion."

This contradicts Documentary Hypothesis source division, supporting instead a unified author who "delighted in dazzling his listeners with the literary technique studied here."

## The Warnings to Pharaoh

Rendsburg identifies two sets of warnings in the plagues narrative:

### 1. "The Morning Warning" (Plagues 1, 4, 7)

Moses instructed to meet Pharaoh at the Nile:

| Passage | Hebrew Phrase | Translation | Variation |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Exod 7:15** | לֵךְ אֶל־פַּרְעֹה בַּבֹּקֶר | "Go to Pharaoh in the morning" | Niphʿal "be positioned" |
| **Exod 8:16** | הַשְׁכֵּם בַּבֹּקֶר | "Arise-early in the morning" | Hitpaʿel "position yourself" |
| **Exod 9:13** | הַשְׁכֵּם בַּבֹּקֶר | "Arise-early in the morning" | Phrase "behold, going to water" omitted |

### 2. "The General Warning" (Plagues 2, 5, 8)

Direct command to confront Pharaoh:

| Passage | Hebrew Phrase | Variation |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Exod 7:26** | בֹּא אֶל־פַּרְעֹה | Verb אָמַר *ʾamar* 'say' |
| **Exod 9:1** | בֹּא אֶל־פַּרְעֹה | Verb דִּבֵּר *dibbēr* 'speak' |
| **Exod 10:1** | בֹּא אֶל־פַּרְעֹה | Delay until 10:3; new content |

### Variations in "Thus Says Yhwh" Formula

| Passage | Formula | Variation |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **7:26** | כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה | Basic form |
| **8:16** | כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה | Lacks particle אֵת |
| **9:1** | כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי הָעִבְרִים | Adds "God of the Hebrews" |
| **9:13** | כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי הָעִבְרִים | Same as 9:1 (rare verbatim) |
| **10:3** | כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵי הָעִבְרִים | Adds rhetorical question |

## The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart

Three Hebrew verbal roots express this motif:

| Root | Meaning | Occurrences |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **ח-ז-ק** *ḥ-z-q* | 'strengthen' | 9x |
| **כ-ב-ד** *k-b-d* | 'make heavy' | 6x |
| **ק-ש-ה** *q-š-h* | 'harden' | 1x |

### Variations with ח-ז-ק *ḥ-z-q* 'Strengthen'

| Passage | Hebrew | Form | Subject |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| **4:21** | אֲחַזֵּק אֶת־לִבּוֹ | Piʿel | God ("I will strengthen") |
| **7:13** | וַיֶּחֱזַק לֵב פַּרְעֹה | Qal | Pharaoh's heart (intransitive) |
| **7:22** | וַיֶּחֱזַק לֵב־פַּרְעֹה | Qal + *maqqef* | Minor modulation |
| **9:12** | וַיְחַזֵּק יְהוָה אֶת־לֵב פַּרְעֹה | Piʿel | Yhwh strengthens |
| **10:20** | וַיְחַזֵּק יְהוָה אֶת־לֵב פַּרְעֹה | Piʿel | Yhwh strengthens |
| **10:27** | וְלֹא אָבָה לְשַׁלְּחָם | New verb | אָבָה 'consent' (rare) |

### Form Follows Content

Rendsburg notes that the verbatim repetition in 7:13, 7:22, 8:15 (with 8:11) serves a purpose:

> "The effect of the three verses as a whole... is to indicate how Pharaoh remained stubborn. He does not change, and the language does not change — a stellar example of 'form follows content'."

When Pharaoh's stubbornness is established, the author returns to variation, demonstrating conscious literary control.

---

## Implications for Source Criticism

Rendsburg explicitly challenges the Documentary Hypothesis:

> "I reject the division of the narrative portions of the Torah into separate sources... we should view the narrative portions of the Torah as speaking with a single narrative voice."

Key argument: Passages assigned to different "sources" (J, E, P) show the same polyprosopon technique, while passages within the same "source" show variation — contradicting source theory predictions.

**Example**: Gen 6:7 (J) and 7:14 (P) use the same animal order, while Gen 6:7 (J) and 7:8 (J) use different orders. The variation crosses supposed source boundaries.

## Egypt Contact and Foreign Terminology

While Chapter 3 focuses primarily on literary technique rather than Egyptian loanwords, the Exodus setting provides context for understanding:

1. **Egyptian cultural memory**: The plagues narrative presupposes detailed knowledge of Egyptian practices (Pharaoh at the Nile, court procedures)
2. **Formulaic speech**: "Thus says Yhwh" parallels ancient Near Eastern messenger formulas
3. **Numerical patterns**: The 10-plague structure, 3+3+3+1 warning pattern

---

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Thesis

### Literary Sophistication

The polyprosopon technique demonstrates that biblical authors were:
1. **Highly literate craftsmen** — not folk compilers
2. **Aware of audience expectations** — for variation and artistry
3. **Working within ancient Near Eastern literary conventions**

This sophistication supports the thesis that they could:
- Preserve foreign (including Aegean) terminology with precision
- Employ wordplay on foreign names (cf. *k-r-t* / Cherethite analysis)
- Maintain cultural memories of Aegean contact

### Oral-Aural Processing

> "The author of Exodus 7–10 utilizes variant language with the aim of dazzling his audience with this virtuosity."

This oral performance context parallels:
- The Palaikastro Hymn's oral liturgical function
- Harrison's analysis of Kouretic ritual performance
- Transmissive patterns between Mediterranean cultures
