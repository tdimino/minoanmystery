## Overview

Chapter 11 demonstrates that sophisticated literary techniques — specifically alliteration — pervade even the "dry" legal-cultic material of the Torah. Rendsburg argues that biblical authors deliberately employed rare words, unusual grammatical forms, and semantic extensions to achieve alliterative effects, even in genres not typically associated with literary artistry.

## Core Argument

> "It is hard to imagine a less obvious place to encounter literary devices in the Bible than the legal-cultic material that dominates much of the Torah (the latter half of Exodus, all of Leviticus, much of Numbers, the majority of Deuteronomy). After all, with no offense intended to the juridical mind at work, legal writing is not known for its literary flair. And yet even in this genre within the Bible one finds the authors employing the techniques surveyed in this monograph."

## Key Examples

### 1. Exodus 29:1 — Israelian Hebrew for Alliteration

The verse uses the atypical form לְקַח *ləqaḥ* 'take' (with retained *lamed*) instead of standard קַח *qaḥ*:

> "The author of Exod 29:1 opted to use the Israelian Hebrew form לְקַח *ləqaḥ* 'take' because the inclusion of the *lamed* creates a **threefold string of alliterative words**: לְקַדֵּשׁ *ləqaddeš* 'to make-holy', לְכַהֵן *ləkahen* 'to serve-as-priests', and לְקַח *ləqaḥ* 'take', all in very close proximity, with /l/ *lamed* followed by either /k/ *kaf* or /q/ *qof* in all three instances."

**Distribution**: The form with retained *lamed* occurs only in 1 Kgs 17:11, Ezek 37:16, and Prov 20:16 — all texts with Israelian Hebrew features.

### 2. Leviticus 10:10–11 — Priestly Duties

The summary of priestly duties (at the end of Leviticus 8–10 investiture) uses the rare verb form לְהוֹרֹת *ləhorot* 'to instruct':

> "The noun תּוֹרָה *tora* 'Torah, law, instruction' occurs 16x in Leviticus, while the verb י-ר-ה *y-r-h* 'instruct' appears only twice, in both cases as the infinitive לְהוֹרֹת *ləhorot* 'to instruct' (Lev 10:11, 14:57). The placement of this infinitive form, in both cases, is due to alliterative concerns."

Alliteration: הַטָּהוֹר *haṭ-ṭahor* 'the pure' + וּלְהוֹרֹת *u-ləhorot* 'and to instruct' — shared /h/ and /r/ sounds with corresponding dentals /ṭ/ ~ /t/.

### 3. Leviticus 13:38–39 — Skin Disease (*bohaq*)

The *hapax legomenon* בֹּהַק *bohaq* 'tetter' was selected for alliterative effect:

> "The sounds of the key word בֶּהָרֹת *bɛharot* 'spots', that is, /b/–/h/–/r/, are echoed in the unique word בֹּהַק *bohaq* 'tetter', with /b/–/h/–/q/."

### 4. Leviticus 26 — *qeri* Cluster

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning | Verses |
|--------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| קֶרִי *qɛri* | qeri | 'opposite, contrary' | 7x (vv. 21–41) |
| לָרִיק *la-riq* | la-riq | 'in vain' | 2x (vv. 16, 20) |
| וַהֲרִיקֹתִי *wahariqoti* | wa-hariqoti | 'empty, unsheathe' | v. 33 |

> "The /q/–/r/ combination is perceived 10x in this penultimate chapter of the book of Leviticus."

### 5. Numbers 18 — *ḥelep/ḥeleb/ḥeleq* Cluster

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning | Consonants |
|--------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| חֵלֶף *ḥelɛp* | ḥelep | 'exchange' | /ḥ/–/l/–/p/ |
| חֵלֶב *ḥelɛb* | ḥeleb | 'fat, suet' | /ḥ/–/l/–/b/ |
| חֵלֶק *ḥelɛq* | ḥeleq | 'portion' | /ḥ/–/l/–/q/ |

Plus anagrammatic pair: חֵרֶם *ḥerɛm* 'proscribed-item' and רֶחֶם *rɛḥɛm* 'womb'.

### 6. Deuteronomy 16:19–17:1 — Alliterative Hook

Three verses on cultic practice (16:21–17:1) interrupt the legal discussion on judges and justice — connected by alliterative verbs:

| v. 19 (Justice) | vv. 21–17:1 (Cult) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| לֹא תַטֶּה 'not pervert' | לֹא תִטַּע 'not plant' (asherah) |
| לֹא תַכִּיר 'not take-notice' | וְלֹא תָקִים 'not erect' (pillar) |
| וְלֹא תִקַּח 'not take' (bribe) | לֹא תִזְבַּח 'not sacrifice' (blemished) |

> "This example illustrates the extent to which the ancient Israelite literati would go to achieve literary effect — even to the point of interrupting a weighty discussion on one topic with an equally serious discussion on another."

### 7. Deuteronomy 24:7–8 — The Priests, the Levites

The kidnapping law (v. 7) leads to the leprosy instruction (v. 8) via alliteration:

- גֹּנֵב *goneb* 'stealing' / גַּנָּב *gannab* 'thief' → בְּנֶגַע *bə-nɛgaʿ* 'concerning the affliction'
- Consonants /g/–/n/–/b/ echoing in anagrammatic /b/–/n/–/g/

**Critical passage** (Deut 24:8):
> כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר־יוֹרוּ אֶתְכֶם **הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם**
> "according to all that **the priests, the Levites**, instruct you"

---

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Thesis

### 1. Priestly Terminology Analysis

The chapter documents how carefully Levitical/priestly terminology was crafted. The phrase "the priests, the Levites" (הַכֹּהֲנִים הַלְוִיִּם) in Deut 24:8 appears in an alliterative context — demonstrating deliberate literary construction around priestly vocabulary.

### 2. Israelian Hebrew and Northern Origins

Rendsburg identifies Israelian Hebrew features (like לְקַח *ləqaḥ*) deliberately used for alliteration, suggesting:
- Northern dialect forms were familiar to Judahite audiences
- Authors could code-switch for literary effect
- Dialect geography relevant to understanding Cherethite/Levite origins

### 3. *Hapax Legomena* as Literary Choice

Multiple unique words (בֹּהַק *bohaq*, חֵלֶף *ḥelɛp*, תְּקוּמָה *təquma*) appear in legal-cultic contexts specifically for alliterative effect — not semantic necessity. This implies:
- Biblical vocabulary was not limited by "source tradition"
- Authors had access to broader lexical resources
- Foreign/archaic terms could be preserved for literary purposes

### 4. Oral-Aural Processing

> "Deuteronomy 26:13–14 constitutes an oral declaration (by the farmer, anticipated to occur in the future, upon Israel's entry into the land of Canaan) within an oral discourse (by Moses on the plains of Moab to the people of Israel); it is this **doubly oral-aural setting that generates the alliteration** here."

This oral context parallels Mediterranean ritual traditions including Kouretic hymns and liturgical formulas.

---

## Methodological Implications

### Rare Words Signal Literary Intent

Rendsburg consistently shows that *hapax legomena* and unusual forms indicate authorial choice, not transmission error:

> "Rare words frequently are invoked *alliterationis causa*."

This principle applies to analyzing foreign loanwords in biblical texts — their presence may signal deliberate preservation of cultural/linguistic contact.

### Unity of Legal-Cultic Material

The sophisticated alliterative techniques across Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy suggest unified authorial consciousness — contradicting source-critical fragmentation.
