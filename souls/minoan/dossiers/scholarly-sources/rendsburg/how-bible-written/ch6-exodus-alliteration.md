## Overview

Chapter 6 continues the examination of alliteration in biblical prose with examples from the book of Exodus. Rendsburg demonstrates how the author of the Moses birth narrative and the plague accounts deliberately selected rare vocabulary—including dialectal variants and Egyptian loanwords—to create sophisticated sound patterns for oral performance.

## Key Examples

### 1. Exodus 1:21 — Houses and Daughters (*Leitwort*)

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| בָּתִּים *battim* | battim | 'houses' | Alliterates with בַּת *bat* |
| בַּת *bat* | bat | 'daughter' | *Leitwort* in Exod 1–2 |

> "Previous scholars have noted that the word בַּת *bat* 'daughter' serves as a *Leitwort* (that is, 'leading word', a word that is woven into several interconnected episodes) in the first two chapters of Exodus (see 1:16, 1:22, 2:1, 2:5, etc.)."

**Technical Legal Idiom**: בָּתִּים עָשָׂה *ʿaśa battim* 'to make houses' = 'to found a family' (Shalom Paul's identification of this Akkadian-Hebrew idiom).

### 2. Exodus 2:3 — Basket and Creation

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| תֵּבַת *tebat* | tebat | 'basket of' | Construct form = same syllable as בַּת |
| תֵּבָה *teba* | teba | 'basket' | Also in Gen 6–9 (Noah's ark) |

> "The author of Exodus 1–2 evokes the language of the early chapters of Genesis... with the theological message that the two greatest events in the history of the world were the creation of the world and the creation of the people of Israel."

**Intertextual Connections**:
- Exod 1:7 echoes Gen 1:28
- Exod 2:2 כִּי־טוֹב *ki ṭob* echoes Gen 1:4

### 3. Exodus 2:2–3 — Months and Loam (Dialectal Variant)

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning | Distribution |
|--------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| יְרָחִים *yəraḥim* | yəraḥim | 'months' | Israelian Hebrew (12x) |
| חֳדָשִׁים *ḥodašim* | ḥodašim | 'months' | Judahite Hebrew (281x) |
| בַחֵמָר *ba-ḥemar* | ba-ḥemar | 'with loam' | Same consonants ḥ-m-r |

> "The use of the standard word חֳדָשִׁים *ḥodašim* 'months' would not have produced the same literary result. Our Judahite author, accordingly, took advantage of the presence of יְרָחִים *yəraḥim* 'months' as a northern regional dialect feature."

**Cognate Evidence**: יֶרַח *yɛraḥ* 'month' corresponds to:
- Ugaritic *yrḫ*
- Phoenician ירח
- Aramaic ירח

> "His (presumably Judahite) listeners, meanwhile, would have raised an eyebrow upon hearing the word, a gesture soon to be followed by an appreciative smile upon hearing the alliterative phrase וַתַּחְמְרָה בַחֵמָר *wattaḥməra ba-ḥemar* 'and she loamed it with loam' in the next verse."

### 4. Exodus 2:2–3 — Hidden and Reeds

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| וַתִּצְפְּנֵהוּ *wattiṣpənehu* | wattiṣpənehu | צ-פ-ן | 'she hid him' |
| הַצְּפִינוֹ *haṣṣəpino* | haṣṣəpino | צ-פ-ן | 'hide him' |
| זֶפֶת *zɛpɛt* | zɛpɛt | — | 'pitch' (rare, 3x) |
| סוּף *sup* | sup | — | 'reeds' (rare, 4x) |
| שְׂפַת *śəpat* | śəpat | — | 'edge of (the Nile)' |

**Alliterative Chain**: Sibilant + /p/ sounds: ṣ-p-n → z-p-t → s-w-p → ś-p-t

### 5. Exodus 5:9 — Labor and Pay-Heed

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Root | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------|
| וְיַעֲשׂוּ *wə-yaʿaśu* | wə-yaʿaśu | ע-שׂ-ה | 'they may labor' |
| יִשְׁעוּ *yišʿu* | yišʿu | שׁ-ע-ה | 'pay heed' |

> "The root שׁ-ע-ה *š-ʿ-h* 'pay heed, have regard' occurs in the narrative corpus of Genesis through Kings only here and in Gen 4:4–5 in the Cain and Abel story."

### 6. Exodus 5:11, 14 — Go/Take and Quota

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| לְכוּ קְחוּ *ləku qəḥu* | ləku qəḥu | 'go, take' (v. 11) |
| כִּלִּיתֶם חָקְכֶם *killitɛm ḥoqkɛm* | killitɛm ḥoqkɛm | 'complete your quota' (v. 14) |

**Consonantal String**:
- v. 11: /l/-/k/-/q/-/ḥ/ (לְכוּ קְחוּ)
- v. 14: /k/-/l/-/ḥ/-/q/ (כִּלִּיתֶם חָקְכֶם)

Both spoken by the שֹׁטְרִים 'officers' in the same scene.

### 7. Exodus 8:10 — Frogs Heaped

| Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| חֳמָרִם חֳמָרִם *ḥomarim ḥomarim* | ḥomarim ḥomarim | 'heaps (upon) heaps' |
| צְפַרְדְּעִים *ṣəpardəʿim* | ṣəpardəʿim | 'frogs' |

## Egypt Contact and Foreign Terminology

### Egyptian Setting as Literary Context

The Exodus narrative presupposes detailed knowledge of Egyptian practices:
- Pharaoh's court procedures
- Nile geography (riverbank, reeds)
- Brick-making with straw
- Plagues targeting Egyptian deities

### Loanwords and Technical Terms

| Hebrew | Origin | Meaning | Occurrence |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| תֵּבָה *teba* | Egyptian? | 'ark/basket' | Gen 6–9, Exod 2 |
| יְאֹר *yəʾor* | Egyptian *itrw* | 'Nile' | Throughout Exodus |
| גֹּמֶא *gomɛʾ* | Egyptian *gm* | 'papyrus' | Exod 2:3 |

## Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos Thesis

### 1. Dialect Geography and Foreign Awareness

Rendsburg demonstrates that Judahite authors deliberately used Israelian Hebrew (northern dialect) forms for literary effect:

> "Under normal circumstances he would not have used this word, but he could not resist its inclusion here *alliterationis causa*."

This implies:
- Authors had access to broader lexical resources across dialects
- Audiences recognized dialectal variants as marked/foreign
- Foreign terminology could be preserved for aesthetic purposes

### 2. Egypt-Canaan Transmission Corridor

The Moses birth narrative deliberately parallels the Flood narrative:
- Same word תֵּבָה *teba* for both Noah's ark and Moses's basket
- Both waterproofed with pitch/loam
- Both involve divine deliverance through water

This narrative pattern supports the thesis of cultural transmission between Egypt and Canaan—the same corridor through which Aegean elements could have traveled.

### 3. Technical Vocabulary Preservation

The identification of Akkadian legal idioms in Hebrew (e.g., בָּתִּים עָשָׂה 'found a family') demonstrates:
- Biblical authors preserved Near Eastern technical terminology
- Legal/cultic vocabulary transmitted across language boundaries
- Parallels to how Caphtorian/Cretan terminology might be preserved

### 4. Oral Performance and Memory

The alliterative patterns were designed for oral performance:

> "His (presumably Judahite) listeners, meanwhile, would have raised an eyebrow upon hearing the word, a gesture soon to be followed by an appreciative smile upon hearing the alliterative phrase."

This oral-aural context parallels:
- Mediterranean ritual performance traditions
- The Kouretes hymn's liturgical function
- Choral recitation patterns across Aegean-Levantine cultures
