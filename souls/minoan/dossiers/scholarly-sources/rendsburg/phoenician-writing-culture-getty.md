## Overview

Rendsburg argues that Phoenicians transmitted not merely the alphabet but an entire **scribal culture** to Greece—a complete lexicon of writing-related vocabulary lacking Indo-European etymologies. He presents 11 Greek words in the semantic field of writing with proposed Semitic (and one Egyptian) etymologies, demonstrating systematic phonetic correspondences. The lecture culminates with the Spensithios inscription from Crete, where *phoinikasein* ("to be a Phoenician") means "to be a scribe"—the most direct evidence for Phoenician scribal identity in Greek consciousness.

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. Writing Vocabulary as Cultural Package

The alphabet was not transmitted in isolation. An entire lexicon of scribal terminology accompanied it—words for writing materials (*khartes*, *biblos*), writing surfaces (*deltos*, *pinax*, *pitakion*), writing tools (*kannai*), and the scribal profession itself (*phoinikastes*).

> "This afternoon I want to take you on a journey into Greek words in the semantic field of writing which lack Indo-European etymologies but which may be explained by recourse to Phoenician and to other Semitic languages."

### 2. Phonological Correspondence Rules

Rendsburg establishes systematic sound correspondences for loanwords:
- Semitic *ḥ* → Greek *χ* (chi): *geret* → *khartes*, *ḥrt* → *harasso*
- Semitic *q* → Greek *κ* (kappa): *qaneh* → *kannai*
- Semitic labial-velar *g* → Greek *β* (beta): *Gubla* → *biblos*

These correspondences allow principled evaluation of etymological proposals.

### 3. The Spensithios Inscription

The Cretan inscription (now in the British Museum) contains the verb *phoinikasein* ("to be a Phoenician") with the meaning "to be a scribe," and the *nomen agentis* form *phoinikastes* meaning "Phoenician" = "scribe."

> "To be a Phoenician or to act as a Phoenician means to be a scribe. There can be no better evidence for the spread of Phoenician writing culture into ancient Greece."

This conflation of ethnic and professional identity demonstrates that Greeks perceived writing itself as a Phoenician art.

### 4. Loanword Re-borrowing (from Q&A)

Semitic languages served as intermediaries for Egyptian vocabulary, then transmitted those words to Greek. Additionally, some Greek words derived from Semitic were later re-borrowed back into Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic:

- *khartes* (Phoenician → Greek) → *kartis* (Hebrew), *kartas* (Arabic, appears in Quran)
- *pitakion* (Phoenician → Greek) → *petaq/pitka* (Hebrew/Aramaic)

This bidirectional borrowing demonstrates sustained cultural contact.

## The 11 Etymologies

### 1. χάρτης (*khartes*) — "papyrus roll"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | χάρτης (*khartes*) |
| **Meaning** | papyrus roll, papyrus scroll, papyrus leaf |
| **LSJ Status** | "etymology unexplained" |
| **Beekes Status** | "etymology unexplained" |
| **Proposed Source** | Phoenician *geret* (גרת) |
| **Evidence** | KAI 81 (Carthage, 3rd c. BCE) - dedicatory inscription; Biblical Hebrew *geret* (Isaiah 8:1) |
| **Phonetic Rule** | Semitic *g* → Greek *χ*, Semitic *r* → *r*, Semitic *t* → *t* |

Rendsburg's interpretation: KAI 81 lists items in a sanctuary; rather than "images" or "sculptured objects," he proposes *geret* refers to written scrolls kept in temples (attested practice throughout Near East).

**Published**: Rendsburg, G.A. (2017). "The Etymology of χάρτης 'papyrus roll'."

---

### 2. χαράσσω (*harasso*) — "to carve, engrave"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | χαράσσω (*harasso*) |
| **Meaning** | to carve, to stamp, to engrave |
| **LSJ Status** | "perhaps a Semitic loan word, cf. Hebrew *harash* 'to engrave'" |
| **Proposed Source** | Northwest Semitic roots: *ḥrt* (to incise), *ḥrš* (to make), *ḥrs* (ostracon) |
| **Evidence** | Kramalkov's Phoenician Dictionary; Latin inscription from Libya (1960) with *engraver* in Punic |
| **Phonetic Rule** | Semitic *ḥ* → Greek *χ* (consistent with *chrysos* ← *ḥrṣ*) |

Three related but distinct Northwest Semitic roots converge semantically:
- **ḥrt**: to incise, engrave (also "to plow")
- **ḥrš**: to make, manufacture
- **ḥrs**: potsherd, ostracon

---

### 3. πιτάκιον (*pitakion*) — "writing tablet"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | πιτάκιον (*pitakion*) |
| **Meaning** | writing tablet, written document |
| **Beekes Status** | "origin unknown" |
| **Proposed Source** | Hebrew/Phoenician *pituaḥ* (פתוח) — "to write, engrave" |
| **Evidence** | KAI 10 (Byblos, 5th c. BCE) — CIS I.1; Hebrew Bible (multiple attestations) |
| **Phonetic Rule** | Semitic *ḥ* (ḥet) → Greek *κ* (kappa) — supported by Ugaritic evidence |

**Key inscription**: KAI 10 from Byblos (discovered, dated to 5th c. BCE):
> "For my lady Baalat of Byblos I made this bronze altar in this her courtyard, and this engraving (*ha-pituaḥ*) of gold which is before my inscription (*pituchiya*)"

The Ugaritic scribes transcribed their *ḥet* consonant with the Akkadian *qu* sign (k-sound), providing precedent for *ḥ* → *k* correspondence.

---

### 4. πίναξ (*pinax*) — "writing tablet"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | πίναξ (*pinax*) |
| **Meaning** | writing tablet |
| **Famous Usage** | Iliad — Bellerophon carries his death notice |
| **Beekes Status** | "probably pre-Greek in view of the suffix" |
| **Proposed Source** | Derived from ethnic *Phoinikes* ("Phoenicians") |
| **Evidence** | Egyptian *fenḥu* (Old Kingdom attestation); proposed by Court Zeta (Berlin, c. 1900) |

Speculative but etymologically grounded: the "Phoenician thing" = the writing tablet. The word may have reached Greek through a different path than direct Phoenician transmission, explaining phonetic variation.

---

### 5. δέλτος (*deltos*) — "writing tablet"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | δέλτος (*deltos*) |
| **Meaning** | writing tablet, column of a scroll |
| **Famous Usage** | Herodotus; Dionysius (for Roman Twelve Tables) |
| **Beekes Status** | Correctly derived from Hebrew/Phoenician |
| **Proposed Source** | Hebrew/Phoenician *delet* (דלת) — "door" |
| **Evidence** | 87 Biblical occurrences; Jeremiah 36 (column of scroll); Lachish Ostracon 4; KAI 43 (Louvre); CIS I.1 (Carthage); Ugaritic tablet |

**Semantic development**: architectural term (door) → column of text (parallels English "column" for both architecture and text).

**Lachish Ostracon 4** (Hebrew epigraphic record):
> "I have written on the tablet (*katafti al-ha-delet*) according to all that my lord has sent to me"

**KAI 43** (Louvre, Phoenician):
> "The bronze plaque (*ha-delet*) which I wrote and nailed upon the wall"

**CIS I.1** (Carthage):
> Reference to a document (*delet*) sealed for a household

**Ugaritic tablet** (Late Bronze Age school exercise):
> Letters R-N-L-Aleph with "answer" (*ma'an*) and "tablet" (*dlt*) — demonstrates the word goes back to Late Bronze Age

---

### 6. ψῆφος (*psephos*) — "voting token, pebble, game piece"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | ψῆφος (*psephos*) |
| **Meaning** | token, oval stone, game board piece, tally, ticket |
| **Famous Usage** | Odyssey Book 1 (suitors playing board game); Herodotus (Anatolian board games) |
| **LSJ/Beekes Status** | "loan word of unknown origin"; "Semitic etymology has been proposed" |
| **Proposed Source** | Aramaic/Phoenician *pss* (פס) or *ps* (פצ) |
| **Evidence** | CIS I.6000; British Museum (Carthage); Marseille Tariff (KAI 69); Latin-Neopunic bilingual (Algeria) |

**Semantic range in Phoenician**: inscription, token, tally

**CIS I.6000**: "they have written... the inscription (*pass*)"

**Marseille Tariff (KAI 69)**: "every payment which is not set down in this inscription (*ps*)"

**Latin-Neopunic bilingual** (Algeria):
> "Examine, O passerby, and read the inscription (*pass*) which is on this stele"

**Post-biblical attestation**: Hebrew/Aramaic *pass* = "city tax" (Tosefta tractate, Erfurt manuscript); Syriac Peshitta uses *patsin* for Jeremiah 36's "columns"

---

### 7. κάνναι (*kannai*) — "reed"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | κάνναι (*kannai*) |
| **Meaning** | reed (writing implement) |
| **Beekes Status** | Semitic loanword acknowledged (Ugaritic, Akkadian, Punic, Hebrew) |
| **Proposed Source** | Semitic *qaneh* (קנה) |
| **Evidence** | ~60 Biblical occurrences; Ugaritic administrative texts (reed imports); Phoenician epigraphic record (CIS 13889) |

**Biblical usage**: construction material (Tabernacle), garden plant (Song of Songs), hippopotamus habitat (Job)

**CIS 13889** (Punic): reference to "seller of reeds"

**Phonetic Rule**: Semitic *q* → Greek *κ* (consistent)

**Latin transmission**: *canna* → Italian *cannoli* ("little reeds")

---

### 8. ἄρον (*aron*) — "plant/reed"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | ἄρον (*aron*), Latinized as *arum* |
| **Meaning** | reed plant, *Arum telecom* |
| **Proposed Source** | Egyptian *irn/irnṱ* — "rush, reed" (masculine); "stem, stalk" (feminine with -t suffix) |
| **Evidence** | Isaiah 19:7 (Hebrew *arot*); Wörterbuch (Egyptian dictionary) |
| **Transmission Path** | Egyptian → Hebrew → Phoenician intermediary → Greek |

**Isaiah 19:7** (oracle concerning Egypt):
> "The reeds (*arot*) upon the Nile, upon the bank of the Nile"

This demonstrates re-borrowing: an Egyptian word enters Hebrew, would have been known by Phoenician traders importing papyrus from Egypt, and passed into Greek.

---

### 9. βίβλος (*biblos*) — "papyrus, book"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | βίβλος (*biblos*) |
| **Meaning** | papyrus, book |
| **LSJ Status** | Very long entry; traditionally derived from city of Byblos |
| **Beekes Status** | Cites Emily Mason (1967) who rejects as "folk etymology" |
| **Proposed Source** | Phoenician *Gubla* (גבל) — city name (Byblos) |
| **Evidence** | Amarna Akkadian vocalization *Gubla*; Ahiram sarcophagus; Yehimilk inscription; 1 Kings (Solomon and Phoenicians) |

**Phonetic Rule**: Indo-European labial-velars shifted to labials. If Semitic *Gubla* had a labialized/rounded *g* (due to following *u*), it could yield Greek *biblos*.

**Amarna evidence**: Akkadian syllabary shows vocalization as *Gubla* (unique among Semitic languages for representing vowels)

**Biblical evidence** (1 Kings): Solomon's dealings with Phoenicians reference *ha-giblim* ("the Byblians")

**Trade route hypothesis**: papyrus scrolls traveled from Egypt up the Levantine coast, through Byblos, following Mediterranean currents to the Aegean. The product carried the place name—parallel to English "china" (porcelain from China).

---

### 10. πάπυρος (*papyrus*) — "writing material"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek/Latin** | πάπυρος (*papyrus*) |
| **Meaning** | writing material |
| **Status** | Etymology still elusive |
| **Proposed Source** | Egyptian *pa-* (definite article) + *pharaoh* item? |

Rendsburg remains agnostic: the proposed etymology (*pa-* + pharaoh-related term = "the pharaoh thing" = magic/royal writing material) is unconvincing. He has not found a better alternative despite extensive research.

---

### 11. φοινικάζειν (*phoinikasein*) — "to be a Phoenician" = "to be a scribe"

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Greek** | φοινικάζειν (*phoinikasein*), φοινικαστής (*phoinikastes*) |
| **Meaning** | "to be a Phoenician" = "to be a scribe" |
| **Source** | Spensithios inscription, Crete (now British Museum) |
| **Date** | Archaic (written boustrophedon) |
| **Scholarship** | Jeffrey & Morpurgo Davies (1971, Oxford) |
| **Dictionary Status** | Still not in LSJ or Montanari's Brill dictionary (as of lecture) |

**Critical evidence**: This inscription demonstrates that in Cretan Greek, "to act as a Phoenician" was semantically equivalent to "to be a scribe." The ethnic identity and the professional identity of writing had merged.

> "To be a Phoenician or to act as a Phoenician means to be a scribe. There can be no better evidence for the spread of Phoenician writing culture into ancient Greece."

## The Spensithios Inscription: Key Evidence

**Physical description**: Written on both sides (boustrophedon), difficult to read

**Location**: Crete → British Museum

**Date**: Archaic period

**Scholarship**: Lillian Jeffrey & Anna Morpurgo Davies (1971, Oxford)

**Significance**:
1. Verb *phoinikasein* means "to be a scribe" rather than ethnic identity
2. *Nomen agentis* form *phoinikastes* = "Phoenician" = "scribe"
3. Demonstrates Greeks perceived writing itself as a Phoenician art
4. Still not incorporated into major Greek dictionaries 50+ years after publication

---

## Loanword Re-borrowing (from Q&A)

Words sometimes travel back to their source languages:

| Original | Greek Form | Re-borrowed Form |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Phoenician *geret* | *khartes* | Hebrew *kartis* (ticket), Arabic *qarṭās* (Quran: paper) |
| Phoenician *pituaḥ* | *pitakion* | Hebrew *petaq*, Aramaic *pitka* (small paper) |

This bidirectional borrowing in Hellenistic and later periods demonstrates sustained cultural contact.

## Earliest Phoenician Writing in Aegean

**Object**: Bowl from Knossos, Crete

**Date**: 10th century BCE

**Inscription**: Vessel belonging to "Shema son of [...]"

**Significance**: Earliest Phoenician writing in Aegean region; predates major Greek alphabetic inscriptions

## Notable Passages

> "I'm a Semiticist and I will begin by saying I am not a scholar of the Greek language per se, although I dabble and today I hopefully will do more than dabble."

— Context: Honest disciplinary positioning

> "I think it's well known in Indo-European studies that the Greek lexicon has more words which lack an Indo-European etymology than you would find in the comparable languages—Latin, Persian, Sanskrit, Germanic, etc."

— Context: Establishing the substrate problem in Greek

> "To be a Phoenician or to act as a Phoenician means to be a scribe. There can be no better evidence for the spread of Phoenician writing culture into ancient Greece."

— Context: Climactic evidence from Spensithios inscription

> "Welcome to the world of loanwords, which sometimes reach languages in different ways even if it's the same word reaching it... How many of us would know, or 3,000 years from now how many people will realize, that the first sound in *Chekhov* and *Tchaikovsky* is the same letter in Russian but Chekhov reached English directly and therefore we spell it with 'ch' but Tchaikovsky reached English through German and therefore it's spelt 'tch.' So the way a word is spelled masks quite a bit often in the world of loanwords."

— Context: Response to methodological question about phonetic correspondence "rules"

> "Never trust a dictionary entry. Go check the text itself."

— Context: Advice to students on philological method
