## Overview

A rigorous linguistic evaluation of Martin Bernal's etymological proposals in *Black Athena* Vol. 1. As a trained Semiticist (student of Cyrus Gordon) and colleague of Bernal at Cornell, Rendsburg brings both expertise and sympathy to the analysis. He establishes methodological principles for evaluating Egypto-Semitic loanwords in Greek, then systematically assesses Bernal's etymologies. Conclusion: most of Bernal's etymologies "stand up to the tests of linguistic analysis."

---

## Key Arguments

### 1. Methodological Framework

Rendsburg establishes principles for evaluating loanwords between Greek and Afroasiatic:

> "Linguists believe, rightly so, that phonetic law is generally immutable. This means that correspondences will be consistent, whether we are dealing with cognates or borrowings. We have a problem, however, when languages or language families remain in contact for thousands of years, as I believe is the case with Greek and Egypto-Semitic." (p. 69)

**The "pater/padre" principle:**
> "An Egyptian or Semitic word which was borrowed very early in the period under discussion may not show the same phonetic correspondences as a word which was borrowed later on." (p. 79)

The same loanword may appear in multiple forms borrowed at different periods—just as English has *father* (native), *pater* (early Latin), and *padre* (late Spanish).

### 2. Nostratic and Loanwords

Rendsburg distinguishes between genetic relationships and borrowings:

> "It is now generally accepted that Indo-European and Afroasiatic are members of the same language phylum, Nostratic. Undoubtedly there are words in the Greek lexicon which are genetically related to Egyptian and/or Semitic. But such contact occurred at an extremely early time, probably no later than c. 10,000 B.C.E. The etymologies discussed by Bernal are due to borrowing at a much later date." (p. 68)

### 3. Third Millennium Evidence

Contacts predate Bernal's second-millennium focus:

> "The most direct piece of evidence is the name of a Fifth Dynasty solar temple (ʿp-rʿ) written in hieroglyphic script inscribed on a stone cup found on Cythera (Gordon 1965:43). We can reach even further back into history if we accept the opinion of Sir Arthur Evans... 'the indebtedness of Crete to *late pre-dynastic and proto-dynastic* Egypt is now substantiated by a cumulative mass of evidence.'" (p. 69)

This means borrowings could have entered Aegean vocabulary two thousand years before Linear B.

## Phonetic Correspondences

### Semitic ḥ → Greek h

| Greek | Semitic | Meaning | Page |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| *haima* | *ḥayyim* | blood ← life | p. 71 |
| *harpē* | *ḥrb* | sickle ← sword | p. 71 |

> "Greek *haima* 'blood' as a loanword from Phoenician *ḥayyim* 'life,' based on the well-known connection in Semitic religion between the two... This is an especially attractive suggestion because the two forms reflect the same diphthong *ai/ay*." (p. 71)

### Egyptian ḥ → Greek Zero

| Greek | Egyptian | Meaning | Page |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| *Kephissos/Kaphissos* | *kbḥ* | river ← cold water, fountain | p. 72 |
| *Athēnai* | *ḥwt nt* | city ← temple of Neit | p. 72 |
| *Io* | *iḥ* or *iḥt* | goddess ← moon or cow | p. 72 |
| *ophis* | *ḥf3w* | snake | p. 72 |
| *Aigyptos* | *ḥwt k3 ptḥ* | Egypt ← house of the soul of Ptah | p. 72 |

> "There is a remarkable consistency here. Moreover, the reflex of Egyptian ḥ by a zero value in Greek is consistent with the universally accepted etymology of *Aigyptos* from Egyptian *ḥwt k3 ptḥ*." (p. 72)

### Semitic ḥ and Egyptian ḫ → Greek kh (χ)

| Greek | Source | Meaning | Page |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| *chrysos* | Semitic *ḥrṣ* | gold | p. 73 |
| *mechri(s)* | Akkadian *maḫrī* | up to, as far as ← in front of | p. 73 |
| *chēra* | Egyptian *ḥ3rt* | widow | p. 73 |

> "The paradigm example is Semitic *ḥrṣ* 'gold' = Greek *chrysos*." (p. 73)

### Labial Correspondences

**Semitic b → Greek p:**
| Greek | Semitic | Meaning | Page |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| *harpē* | *ḥrb* | sickle ← sword | p. 74 |
| *Europa* | *ʿrb* | Europa ← west, evening | p. 74 |
| *gryps* | *krb* | griffin ← cherub | p. 74 |

**Semitic b → Greek b:**
| Greek | Semitic | Meaning | Page |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| *arrabōn* | *ʿrbn* | pledge | p. 74 |
| *balsamon* | *bôšem* | balsam | p. 74 |
| *bomos* | *bamah* | altar ← high place | p. 74 |
| *Belos* | *bʿl* | Belos ← Baal, lord | p. 74 |
| *Kabeiroi* | *kabir* | Kabeiroi ← great | p. 74 |

> "Within Semitic there is a well-attested interchange of the voiced and unvoiced labials *b* and *p*, e.g., *pʿl/bʿl* 'work, make, do', *npš/nbš* 'soul,' etc." (p. 74)

**Egyptian b → Greek ph:**
| Greek | Egyptian | Meaning | Page |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| *Kephissos* | *kbḥ* | river ← cold water | p. 75 |
| *sophia* | *sb3/sb3yt* | wisdom ← teach/teaching | p. 75 |

### Velar Correspondences

**Semitic k → Greek k, ch, or g:**
> "The Semitic phoneme *k* appears in a variety of ways, but in no case would we want to disqualify a particular etymology... such interchanges are already seen within Semitic." (p. 76)

**Semitic q → Greek k (consistently):**
| Greek | Semitic | Meaning | Page |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| *Kary(at)-* cities | *qrt* | city | p. 76 |
| *kudos* | *qdš* | divine glory ← holy | p. 76 |
| *nektar* | *niqṭr* | nectar ← incense | p. 76 |
| *Kadmos* | *qdm* | Kadmos ← east | p. 76 |
| *kōthōn* | *qṭn* | cup ← vessel | p. 77 |

> "What is especially striking about all these equations is that not only do the consonants match perfectly, but the vowels do too. For example, Hebrew *qōdeš* 'holy' is a *u*-class segolate whose protoform can be reconstructed as **qadūš*. Greek *kudos* shows the same first vowel." (p. 77)

## Etymologies Evaluated

### Accepted Etymologies

| Greek | Afroasiatic Source | Assessment |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| *haima* "blood" | Phoenician *ḥayyim* "life" | Attractive (p. 71) |
| *harpē* "sickle" | Semitic *ḥrb* "sword" | Confirmed (p. 71) |
| *Athēnai* | Egyptian *ḥwt nt* "temple of Neit" | Impressive (p. 72) |
| *Aigyptos* | Egyptian *ḥwt k3 ptḥ* | Universally accepted (p. 72) |
| *chrysos* "gold" | Semitic *ḥrṣ* | Paradigm example (p. 73) |
| *sophia* "wisdom" | Egyptian *sb3/sb3yt* "teaching" | Very convincing (p. 75) |
| *kudos* "divine glory" | Semitic *qdš* "holy" | More convincing than IE (p. 78-79) |
| *nektar* | Semitic *niqṭr* "incense" | Convincing (p. 76) |
| *Megara* | Semitic *mʿārâ* "cave" | Impressive—vowels match exactly (p. 77) |
| *martyr* "witness" | Egyptian *mtrw* "witness" | No difficulties (p. 77) |
| *naos* "temple" | Semitic *nāweh* "abode" | No difficulties (p. 77) |
| *Rhea* | Egyptian *rʿyt* "sun-goddess" | No difficulties (p. 77) |
| *gaia/gē* "earth" | Semitic *gayʾ/gēʾ* "valley" | Attractive—vowels match (p. 77) |
| *pyramis* | Egyptian *p3 mr* "the tomb, pyramid" | Most realistic (p. 75) |
| *baris* "small boat" | Late Egyptian *br* | Virtually sure (p. 75) |

### Rejected Etymologies

| Greek | Proposed Source | Problems |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| *harma* "chariot" | Semitic *ḥrm* "net" | Wrong phonetic correspondence; semantic difficulties (p. 71) |
| *(w)anax* "king" | Egyptian *ʿnḫ ḏt* "may he live forever" | Multiple phonetic problems; semantic leap extraordinary (p. 74) |
| *basileus* "king" | Egyptian *p3 sr* "the official" | Linear B *qa-si-re-u* shows earlier **gwasileu-* (p. 75) |
| *Poseidōn* | Egyptian *p3 sḏdn* "he of Sidon" | Etymology unattested; Cretan *Poteidaōn* problematic (p. 76) |

### Words Lacking IE Etymologies

Rendsburg cites Frisk and Chantraine on Greek words without Indo-European solutions:

| Greek Word | Frisk (1954-1972) | Chantraine (1968-1975) |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| *Athēnai* | "vorgriechisch und unerklärt" (1.28) | "théonyme inexpliqué" (28) |
| *gaia/gē* | "ohne Etymologie" (1.303) | "n'ont d'étymologie établie" (219) |
| *haima* | "sichere aussergriechische Verwandte fehlen" (1.39) | "pas de nom du sang commun à tout l'indo-européen" (34) |
| *naiō* | "das Verbalstamm nas... steht isoliert" (2.287) | "ignorée" (733) |
| *nektar* | "ohne sichere Etymologie" (2.301) | "l'étymologie est obscure" (741) |
| *Rhea* | "ohne Etymologie" (2.647) | — |
| *sophia* | "unerklärt" (2.755) | "pas d'étymologie" (1030-31) |
| *xiphos* | "Etymologie unbekannt" (2.337) | "obscure" (767) |

---

## Rendsburg's Own Etymology: *makar* "blessed"

> "The comments of Frisk (1954-1972:2.162) 'ohne Etymologie' and Chantraine (1968-1975:639) 'pas d'étymologie' allow us to look to Afroasiatic for a suitable etymology." (p. 79)

**Proposed derivation**: Greek *makar* "blessed" ← Semitic *brk* "bless"

**Phonological developments required:**
1. **Labial interchange**: Semitic *b* → Greek *m* (parallel: *lēbānōn* "Lebanon" → Egyptian *rmn*)
2. **Metathesis**: *r-k* → *k-r* (common with liquids between 2nd and 3rd position)

---

## The *kudos*/*qdš* Parallel

Rendsburg's strongest counterargument to IE etymology:

> "In the famous passage in Isa 6:3 **qādôš qādôš qādôš yhwh ṣebāʾôt melōʾ kol hāʾāreṣ kebōdô** 'Holy, holy, holy, the LORD of Hosts, his glory fills all the earth,' where 'holy' and 'glory' appear in poetic parallelism." (p. 79)

This semantic parallelism in Hebrew between *qdš* "holy" and *kbd* "glory" supports the connection to Greek *kudos* "divine glory" better than the Slavic *čudo* "wonder, miracle" proposed by IE etymologists.

## Concepts and Terms

| Term | Language | Definition |
|------|----------|------------|
| Nostratic | — | Hypothetical phylum linking Indo-European and Afroasiatic |
| loanword | — | Borrowed word vs. cognate/genetic relationship |
| segolate | Hebrew | Noun class with specific vowel pattern |
| construct form | Egyptian | Bound form (retains final -t vs. absolute) |
| gemination | Semitic | Consonant doubling |

## Notable Passages

> "As a student of Cyrus Gordon, I was trained to look for Mediterranean interconnections and I have made some modest contributions along these lines in my own publications... Furthermore, Bernal quotes my work approvingly on several occasions... Moreover, I consider Martin to be a dear friend and a valued colleague in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at Cornell University. I mention all of this because from the outset I have to state honestly that I am predisposed to accepting the basic conclusions of *Black Athena* in a most sympathetic manner." (p. 68)

— Context: Rendsburg's honest disclosure of his intellectual sympathies.

> "In the end, there are very few of Bernal's etymologies which are not borne out. I have not discussed every one of his proposals, but I think the above survey demonstrates that his approach is sound. In the main, they are internally consistent. When they are inconsistent, they can often be explained by inner Egypto-Semitic developments." (p. 79)

— Context: Final assessment of Bernal's etymologies.

> "The skepticism mentioned at the beginning of this article is unfounded." (p. 80)

— Context: Conclusion rejecting classicist dismissal of Bernal's linguistic evidence.
