# Gary A. Rendsburg - Scholarly Sources Index

## Author Profile

- **Full Name**: Gary Alan Rendsburg
- **Born**: 1954
- **Affiliation**: Cornell University (formerly); Rutgers University (currently)
- **Specialization**: Hebrew Bible, Semitic linguistics, Northwest Semitic languages, Minoan studies
- **Mentor**: Cyrus H. Gordon (Ph.D. New York University, 1980)
- **Key Contribution**: Defended Gordon's Semitic identification of Minoan Linear A; rigorous etymological analysis of Hellenosemitica

## Scholarly Significance

Rendsburg represents the next generation of the Gordon school—a trained Semiticist who brings rigorous linguistic methodology to Hellenosemitica. Unlike classicists who rejected Gordon's Mediterranean interconnections without Semitic training, Rendsburg possesses expertise in Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian, Ugaritic, and other Semitic languages. His work defends Gordon's approach while maintaining scholarly rigor.

**Key methodological contributions:**
1. Systematic phonetic correspondence analysis for loanwords
2. Recognition that borrowings across millennia show variable correspondences (the "pater/padre" principle)
3. Defense of Minoan-Semitic identification against dismissive classicists
4. Application of Minoan evidence to biblical studies

### *How the Bible is Written* (Book, 2019)

A comprehensive dossier collection covering Rendsburg's magnum opus on Hebrew literary technique (12 chapters covered). Housed in [`how-bible-written/`](./how-bible-written/INDEX.md):

| File | Chapter | Key Topics |
|------|---------|------------|
| [ch1-reading-creation.md](./how-bible-written/ch1-reading-creation.md) | 1: Reading Creation | Genesis 1 analysis; *tehom*-Tiamat connection; Masoretic tradition |
| [ch3-plagues-narrative.md](./how-bible-written/ch3-plagues-narrative.md) | 3: Plagues Narrative | *Polyprosopon* technique; Egypt contact; oral performance |
| [ch5-genesis-alliteration.md](./how-bible-written/ch5-genesis-alliteration.md) | 5: Genesis Alliteration | *Hapax legomena*; Ugaritic/Akkadian cognates; phonology |
| [ch6-exodus-alliteration.md](./how-bible-written/ch6-exodus-alliteration.md) | 6: Exodus Alliteration | Egyptian loanwords; Israelian Hebrew dialect variants |
| [ch8-confused-language.md](./how-bible-written/ch8-confused-language.md) | 8: Confused Language | Deliberate syntactic confusion as literary device |
| [ch11-legal-cultic-alliteration.md](./how-bible-written/ch11-legal-cultic-alliteration.md) | 11: Legal-Cultic Alliteration | Priestly terminology; Levites; northern dialect |
| [ch18-wordplay-names.md](./how-bible-written/ch18-wordplay-names.md) | 18: Wordplay on Names | **Cherethite-Cretan *k-r-t* wordplay**; Caphtor = Crete |
| [ch21-dating-biblical-texts.md](./how-bible-written/ch21-dating-biblical-texts.md) | 21: When Was All This Written? | Tenth-century dating argument; David-Genesis connections |
| [ch22-documentary-hypothesis.md](./how-bible-written/ch22-documentary-hypothesis.md) | 22: Challenge to Documentary Hypothesis | Against JEDP; literary unity arguments |
| [ch23-israelian-hebrew.md](./how-bible-written/ch23-israelian-hebrew.md) | 23: Israelian Hebrew | Northern dialect features; Ginsberg's terminology |
| [ch24-style-switching.md](./how-bible-written/ch24-style-switching.md) | 24: Style-Switching | Aramaic elements in Hebrew narrative |
| [ch25-addressee-switching.md](./how-bible-written/ch25-addressee-switching.md) | 25: Addressee-Switching | **Explicit Cherethite-Cretan-Philistine evidence** |

**Relevance to Thera-Knossos-Minos**: Chapters 18 and 25 provide **direct scholarly evidence** for the Cherethite-Cretan connection—Rendsburg documents the *k-r-t* wordplay where prophets exploit the consonantal identity between כְּרֵתִי *kəreti* 'Cretan' and the root כ-ר-ת *k-r-t* 'cut off/destroy'. Chapters 21-24 establish dating methodology and dialectal geography crucial for understanding early Israelite-Aegean contact. The *tehom*-Tiamat discussion in Chapter 1 connects directly to the primordial waters dossier.

## Key Themes Across Works

### 1. Phonetic Correspondence Methodology

Rendsburg establishes rigorous principles for evaluating loanwords:
- Semitic ḥ → Greek h (e.g., *hayyim* → *haima*)
- Egyptian ḥ → Greek zero (e.g., *ḥwt nt* → *Athēnai*)
- Semitic q → Greek k (consistently)
- Variable correspondences reflect different borrowing periods

### 2. Defense of Gordon's Approach

Rendsburg argues that classicists who reject Hellenosemitica typically lack Semitic training:

> "The average classicist knows Greek and Latin, but does not know any Semitic or other Near Eastern languages; whereas the average Semiticist knows not only various Semitic languages, but also Greek and perhaps other languages such as Latin, Hittite, Sumerian, Egyptian, and so on."

### 3. Minoan-Semitic Identification

Rendsburg defends Gordon's identification of Linear A as Semitic, noting that:
- Eblaite precedent shows Semitic languages can have "mixed" features
- Criticisms based on "inconsistent" isoglosses are methodologically flawed
- Academic rejection often stems from prejudice, not evidence

### 4. Biblical Applications

Minoan evidence illuminates biblical texts:
- Administrative lists in Linear A parallel Joshua 12:1-24
- Eteocretan *kol X u-X* parallels Late Biblical Hebrew syntax
- The name element *iš-* in Eteocretan parallels biblical *ʾĪšbaʿal*
