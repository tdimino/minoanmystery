## Overview

These poems embody the Minoan-Semitic thesis that underpins Tom's scholarly work. They perform linguistic synthesis, weaving Hebrew, Phoenician, and Ugaritic with English to invoke the Bronze Age religious worldview. The title poem "Shirat Ha Kotharot" ("Song of the Muses/Kotharot") gives the collection its name.

## Shirat Ha Kotharot
*(Upon hearing Genesis in Biblical Hebrew)*

Aum, ayin, aum…*

Beresheit Ba'alat barat
Eilim wa ha Shamayim
Et wa Haretz

"O eternal eye, O womb...

In Beginning, Mistress you created
The angels, the heavens
And the essence of the Earth"

In the void of grammar, we confined her
and all her Mysteries
but She is wiser

*Begin with aum, ayin, aum until it becomes a stream, then flow into the Beresheit Herself. You will be sparked by the sounds of Ruach ha Qadesh.

### Key Themes
- Regendering Genesis: Ba'alat (Mistress) as creatrix
- Hebrew linguistic play revealing feminine divine
- Mantra/meditation instructions embedded in poem
- The goddess confined "in the void of grammar"

### Linguistic Notes
- **Ba'alat barat**: "Mistress created" (fem. form of Baal + fem. verb)
- **Eilim**: Angels/gods (cf. Elohim)
- **Ruach ha Qadesh**: Holy Spirit (fem. in Hebrew)

## Shirat Ha Yamu
*(Or, "The Song of the Serpent's Sea")*

Am ha Yam ani
U beiti Kaphtor
Baruch iyat Tinit
Ki ne'emar
Kretanit Jed'anit
Ba'alat barat
Asher mimekh
Ani anaf
Ani saraf
Tabul ba'tehomet

"I am a Sea People
And my home is Crete
Blessed isle of Tinit
For it is said:
A wise Cretan woman
You created, Mistress
From whom
I am a branch
I am a sap
Steeped in the deep"

Mine is the ancient song
and it flows through everyone
of every age

### Key Themes
- Sea Peoples identity claimed ("Am ha Yam")
- Kaphtor (Crete) as homeland
- Tinit/Tanit goddess worship
- The "tehomet" (deep/abyss) connection to Tiamat

### Linguistic Notes
- **Am ha Yam**: "People of the Sea"
- **Kaphtor**: Hebrew name for Crete
- **Saraf**: Serpent/seraph (same root)
- **Tehomet**: The Deep (cognate with Tiamat)

"Wielding an alchemical foil, a fire that is like water, that breathes through skin like lightning, may we each rise a little higher, and dig a little deeper, each and every day."

VI.
"All time is but an echo; like art and civilization, it is always cyclical."

## Canaanite

They will say to you, "Your words confuse and elude. Do you mock us?"

You will say to them, "Just as all lands need stewards and guides telling them which crops will be most bountiful, so too do they need strangers inclined to riddle. It is through these darker men and women, children, dogs—all that breathes—that you will see the larger world from which you hail."

They will say to you, "How will we know when we have gone astray? Who should shepherd us?"

You will say to them, "Are you a people of shepherds and herds, or a people of persons? Where are these threats that you see all around you? If a man wakes into a burning home, need he know who to blame upon waking? That man would wake those nearest him, then confront those flames, or flee his home."

### Key Themes
- Dialogue form (prophetic)
- Riddling wisdom tradition
- Critique of shepherd/flock metaphor
- "Strangers inclined to riddle" as wisdom bearers

the prophets have flickered

(for here, water flickers like a flame)
the Cretan god you created
we return from Sheol Yamu
gathered by an ancient song"

Anoki Philistim
Anoki Kana'anim
Anoki Yehudim

We bleed as they bleed,
and our souls are one

## Gospel According to Tammuz
*(Study of "Nag Hammadi Library" and "Stories of Ancient Canaan")*

**I.**
And Yeshua smiled, saying, "When you unify the left and the right, the inner and the outer, the male and the female, such that there is male in the female and female in the male; and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a vision in place of an image, then you will laugh with Shekhinah."

**II.**
"Your leaders and preachers have taken the keys to Knossot from you, though they find themselves barred at its gates. If you would pass through them, be as wise as a serpent, as just as a lion, and as light as a dove."

**III.**
"The tree of the Garden is like the Sun, and its leaves like those of the cypress. Next to it is the tree of Knossos. The tree of Knossot is like the Moon at its most radiant. Its leaves are like the fig, and its fruit like a good date. It serves to rouse the soul from the torpor of the daimones."

**V.**
"Rush your feet, race your wings, for I have a message to unveil, a Mystery to purify: The word of the tree and the whisper of stone! The murmur of the Heavens to the Earth and the Seas to the stars!... In the midst of Tartaros, where divine rivers meet, you will find me, where there is fire that is like water that breathes through skin like lightning."

### Key Themes
- Gnostic-Canaanite synthesis
- Tammuz (dying god) as voice
- Knossos as mystical destination
- "Keys to Knossot" withheld by religious authorities
- Tree of Knossos parallel to Tree of Life
