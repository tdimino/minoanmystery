## Overview

These poems engage with the ancient mystery tradition—the dromena (things done) and legomena (things said) that Harrison identified as the core of Greek religion. They explore ritual as transformative practice, initiation as death-and-rebirth, and the privatization of mysteries as cultural tragedy.

## Boni Dei Antiqui
*(Or, "Honorable Gods of Old" in Classical Latin)*

the weight of the world can be shed
in lightning
and tears

but now
i have to
exhume and bottle what once was

my shadowed-self, a shell

the great cacophony
the shallowed
and concaved
men and women below us

have sealed my own fate
they permit me combustion

and by that
my re-birth

and now i taste it
in my breath
in all the hollows
where once there were temples

---

now spring soldiers! conquerors! ideals!

for this world is not a trapping

it is, in fact, a wrapping
so as to be unveiled.

and what were all those foes, and fears?
but cowardice
but ignorance
but greed

the fire veiled
assails the soul with ire

clutches, then quenches
one's thirst for Revelation in-vitro

in verse, in fact, so as to be staged
so as to be fiery—
Apocalyptic even

for the waters will flow regardless.

i quake at every quieting thought
for justice, progress, peace
as if this piece were any wholier.

### Key Themes
- Death-and-rebirth pattern (combustion → re-birth)
- Hollow temples as lost sacred sites
- World as wrapping "to be unveiled" (initiatory revelation)
- Fire and water as transformative elements

## Maha Shivaratri

The space in-between
is Carib-shelled and crackling
oozing inks azul
dappled edges
blistering to blossom.

Was it not Yahweh who said:

"With princely eyes we survey
all that scurries and agitates itself
with the ceaseless and the trivial."

But such a realm of Elohim
proves itself devoid of eyes.

The Lord Vishnu
who you call Hari
finds himself a kin in every creature
of every origin.

Did She not say:

Estamos juntos
en la oscuridad.
Y al Cosmos
somos claros.

*("We are together in the darkness. And to the Cosmos we are clear.")*

### Key Themes
- Maha Shivaratri: Hindu festival of Shiva (night of dissolution)
- Cross-cultural divine names (Yahweh, Elohim, Vishnu/Hari)
- Critique of hierarchical deity vs. immanent presence
- Darkness as site of clarity

### Ritual Context
Maha Shivaratri celebrates the night when Shiva performs the cosmic dance of creation, preservation, and destruction. The poem uses this frame to critique the "princely eyes" of distant deity in favor of kinship with all creatures.

## Daktyl Dithyrambos

*(The Dithyramb was the wild ritual song/dance from which Greek tragedy emerged. The Daktyls were Cretan smiths/sorcerers who invented metalworking and initiated into mysteries.)*

The poem invokes the ecstatic ritual tradition of Crete—the origin of Greek mystery religion according to Harrison and other scholars.

### Key Themes
- Dactylic/dithyrambic meter as embodied ritual
- Cretan origins of Greek mystery
- The smith (daktyl) as magical craftsman (like Kothar)
- Ecstatic worship

## Kefitzat Ha Derech
*(Re: Ezekiel 25:16-17 and the Mycenaeans)*

Kotharot ha Knossot, Ba'alat barat
Tzadikit ha Tzadikot, Ba'alat barat
Qadeshet ha Qadeshot, Ba'alat barat
Tzadiku ha Tzadikim, Ba'alat barat
(ki hineni, esh mi mayim merachafet)
Ya-wa-Eil ha Eilim, Ba'alat barat
Philisti ha Philistim, Ba'alat barat
Knossot ha Kotharot, Ba'alat barat

"By your will, O Mistress
the Muses commune
the savior is female
the priestess is holy
the prophets have flickered

(for here, water flickers like a flame)
the Cretan god you created
we return from Sheol Yamu
gathered by an ancient song"

### Key Themes
- **Kefitzat Ha Derech**: "Shortening of the Way" – mystical instantaneous travel
- Incantatory/liturgical structure (repeated formula)
- Return from Sheol Yamu (Underworld Sea)
- Gathering by "ancient song" – ritual reconstitution of community

### Ritual Structure
The repetitive formula "X ha X, Ba'alat barat" (X of Xs, Mistress created) follows liturgical patterns found in both Hebrew and Ugaritic ritual texts.

## Cavern Drip

O Cassandra
wet in your waters
sings me a hymn
I know it more than mortals
a soup of twisting tongues
Irish mixing into the Greek until it's
Yeats calling my name from his cave
Minos would you welcome
all that flows down the Styx
the living and the dead
restless with dread
shades of past age

### Key Themes
- Cave as ritual/oracular site (Dictaean cave, Delphi)
- Cassandra as prophetess
- Yeats as modern mystic in cave (Celtic Twilight)
- Minos as underworld judge
- Waters of the Styx

---

## O Zdeu
*(Or, "O Lord of the Sky" in Attic Greek)*

What I see or say is
not me or you or any
one who may be list-
-ening. It's a melody
that only I remember
until I've said it twice
but heard it once alive
hovering in the air like
a threat of darker tidings
storm clouds called then
lost after flash of lightning

### Key Themes
- Invocation to Zeus (Zdeu = Zeus in vocative)
- Poetry as unique utterance
- Lightning/storm as theophany
- The unrepeatable moment of inspiration

## Harrison's Mystery Theory

Harrison argued in *Prolegomena* and *Themis* that:
1. Mysteries were originally public Cretan rites, not secret
2. The essence was purification to handle sacra, not hidden doctrine
3. "Mystery is a rite, a drama, enacted with magical intent"
4. Gods emerged from collective ritual emotion

These poems embody this understanding: ritual as transformative practice, not doctrine transmission.
