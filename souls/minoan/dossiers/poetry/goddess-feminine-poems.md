## Overview

These poems embody the goddess-centered spirituality that pervades Tom's work. Drawing on Harrison's ritual theory, Canaanite religion, and Jung's anima concept, they explore the feminine divine as primary creative force—not as abstraction but as experienced presence.

## Themis kai Gaia

Resting, they sleep on a Giant.
That Giant is a dreamer of worlds.
Hers is a mightiness scarcely understood
But truly felt. All Giants pave their paths
By force. It is Nature that drives them
And it is Nature that is theirs to express.

***

What sacred groves stand?
For poets and thinkers seek
Places mundane and divine
Whispering words once thought
As prayers and meditations.

### Key Themes
- Earth (Gaia) as living Giant, dreamer of worlds
- Themis (divine law/order) as feminine principle
- Sacred groves as sites of poetic/mystical practice
- Harrison's work on Themis as pre-Olympian earth goddess

### Scholarly Connection
Jane Ellen Harrison's *Themis* argues that Themis represents the social conscience—the collective will of the group—older than and underlying the Olympian gods. The poem evokes this pre-patriarchal layer of Greek religion.

## Ba'alat Ackbarat
*(Or, "Laylat Al-Qadrat" in retort to Sheikh Jamil's philology)*

**Note**: The title is a deliberate pun on "Allahu Akbar" ("God is Great"), subverting it to "Ba'alat Ackbarat" ("The Lady is Greater")—a goddess-centered inversion of Islamic monotheism.

Al-lat, Al-Uzzat, Al-Manat
(Almighty Goddess of Destiny)

In purifying a space, you make concessions to it—a berit (i.e., covenant) of rituals that uphold the souls within, and the Spirit beyond. And you remember, when conducted correctly, that Nature triumphs over all man-made marvels, commanding the orchestra of the seas and stars to move exactly as she wishes. When we cease to reckon with the entity that is our planet, this living Goddess, we cease to understand ourselves and our greater connection with the Cosmos; the future and the past; the living and the dead.

People will speak of this awareness as being of a "higher dimension" but this is a quaint concept, given that height is relative to creatures tethered to the dirt. Any intelligence equal to us has reckoned with such thoughts as readily as they might intone a breath, kowtow, or yawn.

But we are not concerned with these linear-led languages. The symbolic become more my ilk, playing with pageantry and mystery in every syllable.

אהית אשרת אהית
*(Ehyeh Asherat Ehyeh – "I Am Asherah I Am")*

### Key Themes
- Triple goddess (Al-lat, Al-Uzzat, Al-Manat) from pre-Islamic Arabia
- Earth/Nature as living Goddess
- Ritual as covenant (berit)
- Hebrew closing invoking Asherah with divine name formula

### Linguistic Notes
- **Ba'alat**: "Lady/Mistress" (Semitic)
- **Ackbarat**: "of the mice" (possible Philistine epithet)
- **אהית אשרת אהית**: Parallels the divine name formula "Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh" (Exodus 3:14) but with Asherah

## Anima

Tell me, tell me, tell me if you love me, she would say.
Never, never, never, would you spit back in her face.

Was it mama or mistress who you saw?
Your matron, or your maiden?
Under covers eyes open and day breaks.

Something slender, for sure, would the hands say, as eyes doted on the same. Could she be more with a name, if she is never more than mine?

Slowly, the shaking would reveal statue under drapery, just as marbled and vain an aberration. Comfort would call to you, singsong, cushioning memories. Staring at the foot, you would remember the sock she forgot to remove and all that that meant. Which woman was she if clothed?

Your aunt, or your anima, the laughing man would say, but she would never hear, you being the only man for her.

Lonesome are those who see no one but themselves.
Loathsome are those who listen to anybody else.

But to see, to see, to see no more–and by seeing, to know what is light and dark, and up and down, and dualistic, and monolithic. To cease to care, simply, would be divine.

### Key Themes
- Jungian anima as inner feminine
- Multiple feminine faces (mama, mistress, matron, maiden, aunt, anima)
- The feminine as mirror of self
- Transcendence through integrated vision

## Sogno ad Occhi
*(Or, "Dreaming with Eyes Opened" in Italian)*

Halls and dusty walls illuminate

as drifting, wizened souls gather
on shelves and shoes in-sync

accordingly their eyes go to stirring
cavern clays of male and female:
forms androgynous and adolescent
silent shadows wading in water

of Revelations, lost libraries
golden leaves and hidden Suns

shine above a rosy wreath
reflecting down its branches
all oracular, in proper order
clouds brushing and trailing brightly

with a sort of majesty
shaking off her sorrow

**she awakens.**

### Key Themes
- Visionary awakening
- Androgynous/adolescent forms (pre-differentiation)
- The feminine "she" as awakening consciousness
- Oracular vision

---

## Succubus (or Lilith)
*(Referenced in Table of Contents)*

The poem engages with Lilith as archetype of the uncontrolled feminine—night-demon in patriarchal framing, but reclaimed as autonomous feminine power. Lilith in Jewish mysticism was Adam's first wife who refused submission.

### Key Themes
- Lilith as pre-Eve feminine
- Demonized autonomy
- Night/unconscious feminine

---

## A Garden Suspended

If the stars still shone
for us, if only
as amethysts
we would be humbled.

At night one looked
into sky and saw
Heaven, as it existed
in all the dreams
turning in the Cosmos.

All fears, all qualms
were quelled in sight
of seas eclipsing
ours in grandeur.

### Key Themes
- Hanging Gardens imagery
- Cosmic feminine (stars, seas)
- Lost connection to celestial wonder
- Humility before cosmic scale
