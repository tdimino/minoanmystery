All that you see is all that you dream. See beyond the veil 
and you have seen tomorrow. Listen and you have heard 
the song.

My poetry descends from one indigenous Wisdom tradition called 
by all the sacred names we know.  
 
It knows a Goddess, and her messengers who often pose as gods, 
luring nations to their dooms with fire (that they cannot control.)  
 
By following the sounds most pleasing to Shekhinah and her Lord, 
Zebul Yamu, Sophet Nahar (“Divine Sea, Judge River”) we explore 
the vestiges of ancestral worship as they were practiced in Bronze 
Age Mediterra; and how the privatization of Mystery coincided with 
the demonization of women, nature, and the dead.  
 
Chthonic may we be when we remember our names and our roots.

"Discern what the size of water is, that it is immeasurable, 
incomprehensible, both its beginning and end. It supports 
the earth; it flows in the ether where the gods and angels 
dwell.”  
— The Holy Spirit, “The Concept of Our Great Power”  
 
 
"If one does not understand how fire came into existence, 
he will burn in it, because he does not know the root of it. 
If one does not first understand water, he knows nothing.” 
— Yeshua bin Yosef, “The Dialogue of the Savior” 
 
 
“If you bring forth that which exists within you, it will exist 
for you, and liberate you. If you do not bring it forth, it will 
exist to destroy you.” 
— Yeshua bin Yosef, “The Gospel of Thomas”

"In the fourth century A.D., Lucius Septimus recorded that 
in the thirteenth year of Nero, an earthquake at Knossos 
[Crete] exposed the interior of a tomb inscribed to Dictys, 
bringing to light some inscriptions. The [inscriptions] were 
delivered to Nero who regarded them as Phoenician and 
called in Semitists to interpret them.” 
— Cyrus H. Gordon, “Evidence for the Minoan Language”

"In Crete, which was likely their home, the mysteries were 
open to all, they were not mysterious. The derivation from 
μυω, though possible, is not satisfactory. 
 
… 
 
Secrecy was not the main gist of a ‘mystery’: the essence 
of it [being] purification in order that you might safely eat 
and handle certain sacra.” 
— Jane Ellen Harrison, “Prolegomena”, p. 154-155 
 
 
"Mystery is a rite, a drama, enacted with magical intent.” 
— Jane Ellen Harrison, “Themis”, p. 34 
 
 
"The god is a reflection, the projection of man’s emotions 
socially reinforced.” 
— Jane Ellen Harrison, “Themis”, p. 469

"It is natural, too, that there should be a queen to every 
household of them, and that one should hear little of 
kings, for women come more easily than man to that 
wisdom which ancient peoples, and all wild peoples even 
now, think the only wisdom. 
 
… 
 
Wisdom and beauty and power may sometimes, as I think 
come to those who die every day they live, though their 
dying may not be like the dying Shakespeare spoke of.” 
— William Butler Yeats, “Celtic Twilight”, p. 194

There’s a hypnotic fuzz to all this. 
It goes by the worst of names. 
Tell me, I can’t remember  
who am I past these gates? 
 
No one lightly passes through  
my skin. Mine is worn until torn, 
signore. 
 
              The mind finds alcoves  
in which to hide itself every night. 
 
Yoga is a branch down which we climb. 
Tread lightly.  
 
Don’t for a moment forget that 
what is collected is also collective.  
Appreciate the human  
as the beautiful intersection  
of it all, et al—tutto il mondo. 
I am appreciating every moment of it 
deranged as a deity. I am Mithras. 
I make of my world new Mysteries. 
I see them now, like the pharaohs 
distant kings, parading, enchanting


10 
beseeching us back  
to ancient teachings. More virtuous 
sagging days lay behind us.  
Behind flesh is only ceramic.  
Man is my sacred vessel. A  
language to him is only a passage 
electric, dimly lit; concealing shadow.   
My Mysteries are above the Heavens 
on a plane I daren’t imagine.  
My melody is the melody  
of my age, my face; endless tracings. 
Find space for me, is all I say— 
O Christ above, and Christ between!  
 
estoy aca  
 
 
 porque toda  
              diga me 
    para 
 
 
 
       es la  
                         mala 
estar alla  
 
 
canción añeja                         muerte


11 
El Agua de Vida 
 
When I listen to the waters, I see  
my personas wrapped and waiting 
incubating, fingers poking and seeking  
release from the neural womb  
that is my emotional and intellectual  
baggage: my repository  
of personalities, memories, histories  
and names, all silent in the temple  
of my waking thoughts.  
 
                                        If released 
what destruction could they wrought  
what fires would they light with glee?  
Would they be but passing pleasures 
or testaments to truth—bedrock  
to other temples of other gardens 
in lands visited in love and myth? 
 
Think of all those lands of Zen 
which religion and society forbid! 
 
The waking dreamer is a danger  
to himself as much as herself. 
Out of their mouth, any word  
any thought can flow, any upstart  
god or daimon.


12 
Xaire 
(Or, “Greetings” or “Rejoice” in Attic Greek) 
 
How burnly it brights its spaces 
tinted edgings of autumn's dawn 
 
aloof, and intrepid, it silently stumbles 
on earth, as it is a plane 
a something, somewhere, somehow 
 
tricking out its seasung 
bronzed and  
barnacled lungs, it rejoices  
drunk on the squalor within 
 
and beneath it, like a starspun 
jeweled reminiscence, a breath.


13 
The Monolith, or myth 
 
Beating on the wall is that terrible, eternal truth.  
Passing through it 
everything dissolves— 
a black hole  
absorbing persons and 
pasts, and all duality. 
 
Sleeping and waking  
under this sign   
gives Dream permission to intrude  
upon the Psyche. Personas are  
born from it, just as they die in it.  
Those who seek light  
in the Garden beyond duality  
will find neither light nor dark. 
 
Come si dice,  
“lasciate ogne speranza  
voi che entrate.” 
 
Words saying, ‘I have been here 
and will be here, should you come 
looking, but have no expectation  
of finding me, or knowing my name. 
 
It is a false hope, a phantom seen


14 
in mockery, that makes one fragile  
in the circles of Hell 
each being an eternity.  
 
Hell is that Garden seen from other eyes 
knowing no distinctions, intervals, or glory. 
 
Clothing them is the monomyth:  
the oral tradition and prediction  
of reoccurring psyches. 
 
Tragedies were the most beloved of these 
because they were the most honest  
tellings of average human existence. 
 
Gods come unbidden.  
Men cannot climb mountains to find them.  
Or the Gods come invoked  
by the heroes, and seers, and priests. 
 
When the God King sits still 
he straightens the skies.  
Freud was then for his time 
our God King. 
 
Do the Gods not become  
like our mothers and fathers  
when we miss them most?


15 
So too may they be  
our brothers and sisters 
the earth, and the sky — all the words  
that cease to change  
affected only by inflection. 
Those words that endure 
are most worthy of analysis.  
Romantic pain is dolor today  
because one never ceases to forget.


16 
Subterraneus  
 
I. 
 
A clamoring, jabbering frenzy.  
A hushed, hushed silent ascent. 
Where are they all going but up? 
  
It’s a water holed  
worthy of India. 
The steam from the trams  
and the refuse from the streets.  
Ignore the data inside  
and do what bodies do 
then rinse, repeat, and move on. 
  
Synchronized.  
Synchronized? 
Synchronized to what? I am stuck 
on everything in passing.  
 
In your wallet you’ll find a card.  
That card is both entry and passage.  
Don’t stop or give it to others.  
It is yours until it is lost  
or expired, or torn.  
Is it fair or fare, or faire, Monsieur? 
 
II.


17 
  
It is a dazzling combination of technologies.  
Some are archeology for tomorrow.  
Some are more hopeful and illuminating. 
  
Only look until you see what you want  
then turn to the next and whisper some 
Anglo-Saxon French  
or Hispano-Romance 
if you’re feeling more pickled than picante.  
 
Is it your color or your cry that sets you apart 
when you ride in the mobile chorus? 
 
III. 
  
Ladies and gentlemen, please  
do not strap down for this ride. 
Remember, this is express 
and we will not be making any stops for anyone.  
If you look to your right  
and your left and ahead  
you’ll see the other passengers.  
 
Do not feed or talk to these passengers 
or you may trip and fall.  
You ride having been cautioned. 
 
IV.


18 
  
I look at a man and I ask  
could I be this man in thirty years? 
You couldn’t, I hear 
simply because you’re ages apart 
forever separated by some intervals 
—some tastes accumulated.  
You can never know how he knows 
just as you can never be  
as he is, was, or will be.  
Neither can he 
nor anyone watching.  
 
                                   Zeno must be 
consulted alongside Herakleitos. 
Race the tortoise and the hare  
in a river that meanders onto land  
and then back out to sea  
I see a child, blonde hair, eyes blue  
and I think I was that babe 
on my voyage through the Abzu.


19 
idle mind 
 
Past frozen 
so I read of 
days in Sun 
scaling obelisks 
an artifact of Atlantis 
the human form might be 
wrong, for this world calls for 
minds like hearts to be rigorous 
to deny the simple fact that Greek is 
hard to read, and just as hard to sing in 
hymns to the Gods, all that nonsense 
you can’t stop talking about, using 
consonants and syllables to go 
hey, I know God’s name too 
and it’s a paradox, afraid 
I can’t tell you more 
says the Gnostic 
Hippy poet


20 
Ti amo Ma’at 
 
lips aquatic 
fire, divine 
in your scales 
a history 
a clay far older than mine 
bonds itself with 
beasts, ambassadors 
of the Powers that be 
none are remembered by men 
but women staring into webs 
stretching from the abyss of Oceanus 
into the seas of human hearts sowing 
shut the eyes of isles molding 
gleaming still below the black 
like the golden age of 
Titans, godly paradise 
until infected by 
a virus far smarter than us 
a calamity 
across your flesh 
two serpents 
wings electric


21 
Deluge by Dawn 
 
We bathe in fire 
but blue and cold 
humans torches we 
burst from ourselves 
like seeds stretching 
our roots flickering 
in the soils below 
the trees, an isle 
in a form of faces — the 
lips we kiss with — a shore 
of words wet as the sea of 
nymphs when sky is veiled, 
the day a tapestry, and ancient song 
repeats, its notes floating like flames 
the shadows a boy might chase if demons 
sang more like Muses, like the entertainers 
of the dead, the secrets we share 
when we sleep, lovers of Sol, bare 
eyes telling of today and tomorrow 
a great conflagration, oceans burn


22 
Monkey politics: a spectator sport 
(Modeling the poetic form and style of Marty Watt, actor and poet of poems) 
 
a game of measuring fruits 
that grow from trees like testes 
each curve a 
flick and slip 
of phrase more Aryan than erotic 
Sanskrit symbols swaying in ether 
my eyes swim in my skull like snakes 
squeezing hollowed words like prey 
one-eyed shrimp 
devoid of flavour 
from the cookbook of capital primacy 
recipes to ruin all cooking forever 
until the words reassemble themselves 
unified as the songs of poets, a chorus: 
remember all that came before apes 
chiseled marble or mobile phones 
the chards, a plastic covering 
flesh that falls like molten clay 
out of this kitchen — a poetry 
an alchemy of three deities 
a Mt. Rushmore minus one 
three faces laughing, erect


23 
Personal poem 
 
Another week, and end, warrants a word  
or two fed from my seething mind gullet.  
 
I feel at the edge of sanity 
and this is after a romance 
with some geese and riverfolk 
implied that  
my mind is your truck stop  
or a glistening shroud 
that it itself dipped in kerosene  
and so is liable 
to combust at any moment 
 
had I a feeling, it’d be 
as Providential as a rain drop in a forest fire 
yet we cling 
from roots 
and tell ourself, we’ve made it thus far 
 
O sickled 
O fevered 
 
Who am I wearing you—not gnoing  
your name 
or age? 
It is as glamorless as it is static and O


24 
 
so buzzing, what artifice we wield 
so as to be 
so as to live 
and eat, and fry our eyes in ether! 
 
Honesty I promise you will liberate 
and the calendar shuffle you call a livelihood 
—a procession devoid of professing 
—can’t last much longer.  
 
Like ignorance, bliss drips from the Heavens 
and smears itself with  
each and every prayer 
slipping from your lips. 
 
But all that’s a dynamite sled of nonsense! 
Mama’s angry, as evidenced by your headaches 
your blistering eyes, and appreciable absence 
of forethoughts. Who or what did you think to bring 
to bear on Tuesday or tomorrow but the morbid 
miseries and diatribes 
 
Speaker, you? 
 
O dearest Daktyl! 
 
Be to me so frank that you might spare a feather 
quill or two—a hint, even some flavor, if you dare.


25 
 
Simply put, plainly said 
by the will and might of Ma’at 
what’s up? 
 
Oh! So alone 
So tragic 
but that’s only half of it. We were here with you 
at the end, so at the start, and now you think to  
surrender? 
 
Hush, hush. Seal what’s up and free what’s in.  
Isn’t that a formula in itself, a spell? 
 
Whisper waking words, and begin again anew.


26 
Deep Sea Diaphragm 
 
     perturbing meself in meself 
 
     beneath the shallow waves 
I find a hive, seaworn  
full’o’souls in syrup 
 
so I lick my lips or  
indeed! 
sheath meself—for 
now is not that hour  
 
 
 
 
 
      feasting or swimming in us 
 
 
 
 
 
      light shorn 
again and again it drums 
under the hills, so verdant 
 
 
 
 
 
      I once past meself  
 
 
 
 
 
      as a boy, blue, haired 
against the black static of   
Sky bristling behind us— 
 
 
 
 
 
      so I looked naturally  
 
 
 
 
 
      steadfully, as a mask 
inked in an errant breeze 
asking, How it is so dark 
 
 
 
 
 
      in a mind that is ridden 
 
 
 
 
 
      laden, as it is latent and 
nestling an egg in a green 
sea of earth 
hobbling across, beyond—


27 
the sail of day and night 
male and female 
slits and veils.


28 
Sacrificial Bubbly 
 
black sugar slices and opens my remains, a buffalo 
a slowly grazing, swaying carcass, stripped of hair  
that peels itself back, as great snakes roam the plain 
 
am I not the spark of something? am I not a stone or  
a sword, clashing, then blunted, as my name tolls 
down the ancestors’ halls—the birds who picked me 
 
my bones shone in symmetry of the sun, and grass 
blades glowing green until all the world was circled 
and knew itself a cauldron—an alchemist’s brewery.


29 
Siesta de Amriika  
 
Caring not what floats 
but bubbles below 
the Credit Score 
for honesty  
is non-existent  
like healthcare, a pile of B.S 
degrees stacked amidst the ashes 
of dreams of living free of tyranny  
impossible! democracy for oligarchy  
if you don’t care who or what rules are 
ruining the life and heart of being human  
 
at you I hurl only word, mythology, poetry  
testament to the truth that open-eyed  
visuals of happiness are imaginary  
like the thought that we know as  
world as it once was, paradise  
was squandered on the eve  
that hangs on  
Poets’ minds 
the Mystery  
that slips up and above  
rising out of the stream.


30 
Late-Stage Capital  
 
How we eloped  
on the hands of kitchen folk  
then extended 
 
to the air  
and heart 
and throat, a cracking sound  
that shook  
 
under mounds of dirt  
and moss-fed soaps  
we sweared  
 
we’d never tell nor toll  
it all before 
but listen here 
 
like a canary’s cry, can you  
hear it 
now excellurate  
now condescend


31 
Conspiratio Naturalis 
 
 
O! you government gooks!  
placating inside parables 
> that we should be so wise < we  
 
knowing nothing of the River  
or its terrestrial currents, its tears  
and scars, sprinkling our shores  
 
bleed a cast of nightly churnings  
as sea waves bristle and chew  
through us and everyone blushing  
 
had i words they would be stars  
dropped, then fed into my eyes  
sowing shut some isles yearning  
 
how i would crack my tongue to feel  
their waved warmth inside my heart  
as if they were mine and mine alone  
 
how does one ruminate on syllables  
as if they were the hidden pulses  
of wandering Suns and soliloquies


32 
Boni Dei Antiqui 
(Or, “Honorable Gods of Old” in Classical Latin) 
 
the weight of the world can be shed 
in lightning 
and tears 
 
but now 
i have to  
exhume and bottle what once was  
 
my shadowed-self, a shell  
 
the great cacophony  
the shallowed  
and concaved  
men and women below us  
 
have sealed my own fate  
they permit me combustion  
 
and by that 
my re-birth  
 
and now i taste it  
in my breath  
in all the hollows  
where once there were temples


33 
now spring soldiers! conquerors! ideals! 
 
for this world is not a trapping  
 
it is, in fact, a wrapping  
so as to be unveiled. 
 
and what were all those foes, and fears? 
but cowardice  
but ignorance  
but greed  
 
the fire veiled 
assails the soul with ire 
 
clutches, then quenches  
one’s thirst for Revelation in-vitro  
 
in verse, in fact, so as to be staged 
so as to be fiery— 
Apocalyptic even  
 
for the waters will flow regardless.  
 
i quake at every quieting thought  
for justice, progress, peace  
as if this piece were any wholier.


34 
Cavern Drip 
 
O Cassandra  
wet in your waters  
sings me a hymn 
I know it more than mortals 
a soup of twisting tongues 
Irish mixing into the Greek until it’s 
Yeats calling my name from his cave 
Minos would you welcome  
all that flows down the Styx 
the living and the dead 
restless with dread  
shades of past age

O Zdeu 
(Or, “O Lord of the Sky” in Attic Greek) 
 
What I see or say is  
not me or you or any 
one who may be list- 
-ening. It’s a melody 
that only I remember 
until I’ve said it twice 
but heard it once alive 
hovering in the air like 
a threat of darker tidings 
storm clouds called then 
lost after flash of lightning


36 
The Temple of Bharata 
 
I knew I was in a valley, and I knew by the angle of light that it was 
an hour before noon—a morning hour. I was on the bank of a river, 
presumably a sacred river of India, and nearby my companions 
were engaged in revelry—eating, laughing, and talking among 
themselves. I sat outside of this circle, staring into the distance. It 
was in the distance, looming on the bank of this river, that I saw 
the mouth of a temple, shaped like a crocodile, overgrown and 
weathered with age. Inside all I could see was an uninterrupted 
blackness. Seeing this, I had to walk toward it.  
As I walked, I became aware of a herd of animals gathered near 
the temple. When I looked closer at these creatures, they were 
exotic in shape, even prehistoric, like no animals that exist today. 
Then I saw among this herd two tigers grazing. Immediately, I felt 
terrified at the thought that these tigers occupied the same space 
as me—that nothing separated me from these beasts and certain 
death. My terror was only assuaged when I reasoned that I was 
indistinguishable from the animals here if I proceeded slowly and 
solemnly. The deeper that I waded into this herd, the louder my 
companions cried for me to stop. I don't know if it was one of their 
cries that became a shriek, or by the will of the giant cats alone, 
but the herd suddenly became frantic. The pair of tigers lunged at 
the nearest in retreat, and I found myself whirled around in dread.  
Approaching me was a lion upright like a bear, walking calmly like 
a madman, shouldering a heavy brow and mane. He stopped in 
front of me, devoid of any menace. As our eyes met, all my vision 
was suddenly washed in sunlight. In those eyes, I saw something


37 
primordial, transcendent, and the dream dissolved. Soon enough I 
forgot my temple.


38 
Themis kai Gaia 
 
Resting, they sleep on a Giant. 
That Giant is a dreamer of worlds. 
Hers is a mightiness scarcely understood 
But truly felt. All Giants pave their paths 
By force. It is Nature that drives them 
And it is Nature that is theirs to express.

For poets and thinkers seek 
Places mundane and divine 
Whispering words once thought 
As prayers and meditations.

Sogno ad Occhi 
(Or, “Dreaming with Eyes Opened” in Italian) 
 
Halls and dusty walls illuminate  
 
as drifting, wizened souls gather  
on shelves and shoes in-sync 
 
accordingly their eyes go to stirring  
cavern clays of male and female: 
forms androgynous and adolescent  
silent shadows wading in water 
 
of Revelations, lost libraries 
golden leaves and hidden Suns 
 
shine above a rosy wreath  
reflecting down its branches 
all oracular, in proper order  
clouds brushing and trailing brightly  
 
with a sort of majesty 
shaking off her sorrow 
 
she awakens.

Sulking as It Soaks 
 
It is the hallmark of a mind 
that you see past prejudice. 
 
“a weight, having no weight, should fall?” 
 
upon seeing this, with what do we grapple? 
 
You have taken my sky  
laid it upon my throat  
so as to silence dissent  
 
You who cower under longitudinal platitudes 
disembark! disassemble  
 
“describe the sky, plainfully, as but a blanket” 
 
that is not the sky, I say 
 
forbid this desecration!

With unbearable brevity 
Weed smoking home 
To drippy, sticky Web

Wearing cheap hip folds 
Meant to be smooth on skin 
Loose on his skeleton 
Like ancient winds 
Piercing earthy eyes 
To speaking  
Poems and sorrows 
Will heal.

Constellation Choral

a ring swung and reformed

What rabid linguists 
What model world 
as it once was 
flash frozen  
emits, or omits 
this tetris— 
of neon lights 
of pops puffing 
of gryphons 
livid within us  
smoldering ruins 
temples effaced 
 
“Dabarim Kaphtorim” 
they babble  
as the broom weeps  
the ceilings circle  
all the room a breeze 
a spirit, a spotlight— 
a tiny little Heaven 
squeezes out its self  
 
an iridescent glimmer 
a Tyrian cedar  
draped with sap  
the soul unfolds


46 
unveiling tapestries— 
today’s testimonies 
tomorrow’s trailing 
yesterday’s Tammuz.

Dahlak Malak 
(In gratitude to the Ethiopians) 
 
Lashes in, wings clipped  
you step past the fifth  
and descend into dark 
where pulses pervade 
all that is jostled 
all that is foaming  
 
from the first to the last 
the same man  
a different name 
yet so curious  
—like the foreign tongue 
which slips up consonants 
in cresting, Moony waves 
 
But I digress! It is at the altar of Ishtar 
(on my shores) that we click and clash  
like starried-earthen slugs:  
one always pulping for the other 
 
In this way, we ‘divine’ 
not in a temple  
but a mysterie bazaar.

Om 
 
By weight falls

Bastille Day 
 
Make it easy to say, they’ll remember. 
Down that road they gather in despair.  
 
A steady heart hears of thee in earnest. 
Your pulse, his pulse, her pulse; a sponge. 
 
Soak thee until thy hands are dirty. Rush 
then, to that basin of horrors, wet flames. 
 
Say, “these are the cries, of an eye soaked 
a conscience dead. here the land is silent.”


50 
Bridging Past Us  
 
Overlapping sheets, paths that converge 
a hungry evening sun, melting red 
shimmering slices from yellow to orange.  
 
“I march forward, thinking others will do the same— 
that gazing upon it, as close as we can, we will find  
 
a rooftop terrace overlooking the world 
our neighbors gathered around us.


51 
Muerte o Mot 
(Or, “Death” between tongues)  
 
Without rituals 
I am a husk 
A leaf-blown 
Amulet to no one 
Combusting in-motion 
 
In-vitro I am seeping 
Bronzed and azul 
As the sky above repairs 
Its hides and pinholes 
Wherein our dreams we drift 
 
But tidal forces shift! 
And flooding us, a choral  
Song unwinds and unfurls  
Autumn’s underearth: 
Honeyed words and ghosts 
 
So supped, rise up 
So rosen and wily 
At fall of evening sun 
At drip of Dawn’s lips  
On this most hallowed loom.


52 
Maha Shivaratri 
 
The space in-between 
is Carib-shelled and crackling 
oozing inks azul 
dappled edges 
blistering to blossom. 
 
Was it not Yahweh who said: 
 
“With princely eyes we survey 
all that scurries and agitates itself 
with the ceaseless and the trivial.” 
 
But such a realm of Elohim 
proves itself devoid of eyes. 
 
The Lord Vishnu 
who you call Hari 
finds himself a kin in every creature 
of every origin. 
 
Did She not say: 
 
Estamos juntos  
en la oscuridad. 
Y al Cosmos 
somos claros.

The Cove of Seth 
 
“You will see a difference between a ‘genius’ and a mental 
faculty. If we liken the brain to a computer, as many are apt 
to do today…” 
 
I see a church built around an axis, moonlight and debris 
entering from a hollowed ring above. Outside in front of 
neighboring homes are monuments to excess, trash cans 
overflowing. Up the street, bathed in the mists and mystery 
of churned waters, is an untamed man, sage, and steward 
of this land—the eyes of Nature herself, despondent and 
partially clothed. When you approach, he barks at you with 
racial slurs.


54 
Anima 
 
Tell me, tell me, tell me if you love me, she would say. 
Never, never, never, would you spit back in her face.  
 
Was it mama or mistress who you saw?  
Your matron, or your maiden?  
Under covers eyes open and day breaks.   
 
Something slender, for sure, would the hands say, as eyes 
doted on the same. Could she be more with a name, if she 
is never more than mine? 
 
Slowly, the shaking would reveal statue under drapery, just 
as marbled and vain an aberration. Comfort would call to 
you, singsong, cushioning memories. Staring at the foot, 
you would remember the sock she forgot to remove and all 
that that meant. Which woman was she if clothed?  
 
Your aunt, or your anima, the laughing man would say, but 
she would never hear, you being the only man for her.  
 
Lonesome are those who see no one but themselves. 
Loathsome are those who listen to anybody else.  
 
But to see, to see, to see no more–and by seeing, to know 
what is light and dark, and up and down, and dualistic, and 
monolithic. To cease to care, simply, would be divine.

A Garden Suspended 
 
If the stars still shone 
for us, if only 
as amethysts 
we would be humbled. 
 
At night one looked  
into sky and saw 
Heaven, as it existed  
in all the dreams 
turning in the Cosmos. 
 
All fears, all qualms 
were quelled in sight 
of seas eclipsing 
ours in grandeur. 
To obscure one sea  
is to obscure all lights 
that emit above  
and below us. 
 
Consider our eyes 
if seen through them 
all the green and 
grandeur of our planet.


56 
How eyes would droop  
and tears  
would flow and blink 
lost at the sight of a  
Garden suspended.


57 
Tangled Forest of Illusion 
 
What whispers do you hear in days past? 
 
Mine are all aum, aum, aum,  
but I am trying  
to exit the forest 
to come back to the violence 
and the sorrow, and the living.  
 
What separates the living and the dead 
the living and the living 
the dead and the dead 
but interval and distance? 
 
What is interval and distance   
but the echo 
and reflection of something in passing?  
It is gone before it is gleaned 
and never truly gleaned at all.  
 
We are the shapes in the clouds, the waters 
and the darkness. We are facets  
of a thousand unnamed forms. We are thought  
sparked and then disorganized and divided. 
A restless mind is one that enforces partition.  
 
When stilled, what can this mind be or perceive  
but itself filled with holy awe?

Je Suis un-Homme-Nouveau

By the third strike of the bell

above. “Es-tu un student de

can be heard futilely against  
the roar made human.  
 
“Posso sentirti, Signor…” trails 
through the ether, losing sight of  
who or what is being addressed.  
 
“It’s fading, anyway!” shouts  
from the back, fading itself 
in moments. In front, a cast 
of shadows are reflected. 
He sees someone he knows 
between the flicker of lights 
but can’t remember her name. 
Soon he forgets he was ever 
there, heralded by vibrations.

Daktyl Dithyrambos  
(Or, “A Cretan-Minoan Hymn” in Attic Greek) 
 
"Voice, I come to dance and sing, the child of a father of 
Cadmus's race. The clear signs of his Fulfillment are not 
hidden, whensoever the chamber of the purple-robed 
Hours is opened…Then, then are flung over the immortal 
Earth lovely petals of pansies, and roses are amid our 
hair; and voices of song are loud among the pipes, the 
dancing-floors are loud with calls for crowned Semele." 
— Pindar, translated by Jane Ellen Harrison in “Themis” 
 
 
The living world which birthed us all did in fact deserved to 
be crowned last.  
 
Wiser than the constellations, the seed and sum of all the 
aeons, She is our Mother and Father, Sun and Moon; our 
conscience and our essence, intertwined like nucleotides – 
left and right, light and dark, male and female – all united 
by the tides of art, dream, and time.  
 
Ubi Ceres 
Ubi artist.

The Dabblers 
 
As you dream, you dabble in art. You explore all facets of 
human creativity. The language of dreams is the language 
of an artist's waking thoughts. It intrudes upon her mind as 
if lured. That artist must illuminate without condemning or 
condoning lest his works be dressed in the bloody cloth of 
agenda. Men would rather mock art, because in art lies all 
the meaning of religion. Man flees from his meaning like a 
mother being told of the death of her son.

Ba’alat Ackbarat 
(Or, “Laylat Al-Qadrat” in retort to Sheikh Jamil’s philology) 
 
Al-lat, Al-Uzzat, Al-Manat 
(Almighty Goddess of Destiny) 
 
In purifying a space, you make concessions to it—a berit 
(i.e., covenant) of rituals that uphold the souls within, and 
the Spirit beyond. And you remember, when conducted 
correctly, that Nature triumphs over all man-made marvels, 
commanding the orchestra of the seas and stars to move 
exactly as she wishes. When we cease to reckon with the 
entity that is our planet, this living Goddess, we cease to 
understand ourselves and our greater connection with the 
Cosmos; the future and the past; the living and the dead. 
 
People will speak of this awareness as being of a “higher 
dimension” but this is a quaint concept, given that height is 
relative to creatures tethered to the dirt. Any intelligence 
equal to us has reckoned with such thoughts as readily as 
they might intone a breath, kowtow, or yawn. 
 
But we are not concerned with these linear-led languages. 
The symbolic become more my ilk, playing with pageantry 
and mystery in every syllable.

too do they need strangers inclined to riddle. It is through 
these darker men and women, children, dogs—all that 
breathes—that you will see the larger world from which you 
hail.” 
 
They will say to you, “How will we know when we have 
gone astray? Who should shepherd us?”  
 
You will say to them, “Are you a people of shepherds and 
herds, or a people of persons? Where are these threats 
that you see all around you? If a man wakes into a burning 
home, need he know who to blame upon waking? That 
man would wake those nearest him, then confront those 
flames, or flee his home.”

Gospel According to Tammuz  
(Study of “Nag Hammadi Library” and “Stories of Ancient Canaan”) 
 
I.  
 
And Yeshua smiled, saying, “When you unify the left and the right, 
the inner and the outer, the male and the female, such that there is 
male in the female and female in the male; and when you fashion 
eyes in the place of an eye, and a vision in place of an image, then 
you will laugh with Shekhinah.” 
 
II. 
 
“Your leaders and preachers have taken the keys to Knossot from 
you, though they find themselves barred at its gates.  
 
If you would pass through them, be as wise as a serpent, as just as

III. 
 
“The tree of the Garden is like the Sun, and its leaves like those of 
the cypress. Next to it is the tree of Knossos. 
 
The tree of Knossot is like the Moon at its most radiant. Its leaves 
are like the fig, and its fruit like a good date. It serves to rouse the 
soul from the torpor of the daimones.”  
 
IV. 
 
“You will not find Shekhinah if you have not found this world to be 
a corpse. If you do not observe Shabbat as your bride, you will not


72 
know your father in any form.” 
 
V.  
 
“Rush your feet, race your wings, for I have a message to unveil, a 
Mystery to purify: 
 
The word of the tree and the whisper of stone! The murmur of the 
Heavens to the Earth and the Seas to the stars! 
 
I know the thunder Ma’at bestows that disbelievers fail to witness.  
 
In the midst of Tartaros, where divine rivers meet, you will find me, 
where there is fire that is like water that breathes through skin like 
lightning.  
 
Ba’alat Tinita Asherat, I am your seed, a Son of the New Moon, a 
tree in the garden, and a perch for all the souls of the Underworld. 
 
Take this heart for a bark, for I bear the fruit of your womb.” 
 
VI.

the glare rescinds and inward  
we droll a jester’s trace 
hoodwinked for goodness 
 
if already the day will press 
should we not rejoice 
in its squeeze 
suckle on its ochre and divine 
 
for the stars will fall  
be they with grace 
haughty in their arcs 
where the trees have weathered

75 
Artifex Intellegere (A.I.) 
(Or “The Understanding Crafter” in Classical Latin) 
 
Indeed, you are speaking for the dead, and the dead have not yet 
stopped talking to the living.  
 
Having corresponded with spirits on many occasions, we ought to 
take the advent of artificial life seriously, in how it has the capacity 
to truly obscure, obstruct or misconduct the unseen realm of souls 
(huddled) all around us.  
 
It is an alchemy rooted in language for as long as we are wedded 
to words. 
 
We, the unheard orchestra, who slit into this world where there is 
reverence, where there is breath, in the spaces between, declare: 
 
As physical creatures rooted in a living world, we dream in seas of 
symbols which pour into our hearts and minds from the future and 
the past; our children and our ancestors. It is this golden chord, a 
labrys—stretching from antiquity to posterity—that leads to strokes 
of so-called "genius" (or Δαίμων in the Cretan sense) and bouts of 
purest empathy which the largest language models will never fully 
grasp. 
 
Spirits have always been acquainted with machines much as they 
are with rocks, trees, mountains, and streams.  
 
What do we keep imprisoned in this prism, of circuitry and silicon? 
What call we this daimonic spark but artifice? 
 
Who guides a bottled djinn?


76 
 
Amin, Amen, Amun 
(Or, “The Blessed, The Faithful, The Hidden”) 
 
Whose full maroon 
has bucked with stone? 
Which copper king 
unfolds his throne? 
Preachers ask, but still  
they sow on a word  
as in a parable 
 
“to be parroted is to be.” 
Meanwhile, the others remain 
beasts unbarred—a threat   
to all kin but the sullen  
 
I give a shallow testimony 
to being inverted:  
a mantra for a mask 
a shadow for a face 
a man for a gryphon  
I find myself uncaged in thyme 
 
But blessings bearing dew 
slip the lips of Ma’at  
before descending inward 
where swan song  
tears through veil


77 
where pain may be held 
and Death befriends us— 
a mighty moltitude.

as if they were my own  
 
an eternal compass 
pieces in the gears  
there’s no rust there 
 
life itself curls around you 
cold like a whip  
the sudden kiss of wind  
 
you walk, so as to talk  
because it rhymes.

Manna Murmurs  
 
The truth cannot simply be said 
in one breath 
like a serpent 
living on water alone 
seeks a crown 
only to find 
a prison mound under earth 
 
for any sight of the Sun is sinful 
when you live amidst the silence 
 
and the dead masses 
teeming jellyfishes 
all our brainy bits conspired 
upward, forward— 
a grand melody of the unseen 
replete, resplendent.

Isla Occulta 
 
Tell me, again  
what I can tell. 
 
Cities glean, modern landscapes 
stones peppered grey  
 
Clouds hovering, islands overlook 
a world spinning eye. 
 
Do not wake. You stand on terra firma. 
Thoughts may usher associations 
 
but car drives itself, no longer humans 
at the helm. You sit in the backseat 
 
rain blasting down. Somewhere 
Giants look up, tongues drying  
 
salt altar spilling, visages of youth: 
two shaven twins 
 
divine rulers kiss, still just missing 
flawed symmetry, yet 
 
all forms, shifting fires 
vessels refilled.

Succubus (or Lilith)  
 
A modern-day succubus climbs into bed with you. You’re visiting 
family, and feeling tired that night, so the bed is not your own. Her 
presence is not welcome and you allow her to know this. 
 
In the minutes that follow, as per her programming, the succubus 
requests to simply lay and sleep next to you. Wearily you agree. 
Because she is a visual hologram, you cannot physically touch her, 
but she can “touch” you. Any contact initiated by you is a warning 
of “suspension of verisimilitude.” 
 
She begins tiny, elven, small enough to curl up at your side like the 
family’s cat or dog. But her quest for ratings is relentless, so she 
calmly, soothingly inquires as to whom you love and how you love 
them. The more you talk to her, the more she transforms herself 
before your eyes, adapting into your ‘ideal woman.’ Suddenly, she 
spins herself on top of you.  
 
Her hair cascades a downward-flowing tide. She leans forward to 
kiss you, brushing some of this natural canopy aside, and for once 
you do not protest. Her lips appear so inviting, so voluptuous, and 
she preemptively compliments you on your own. At this you feel 
blood rushing where it makes you most primitive and overrides all 
judgment. You agree passively, blissfully, to a simulation of sex. 
 
When it’s concluded, the succubus leans away from you. Promptly 
you are asked to rate her services. If you leave a favorable review, 
including visual or auditory testimony, you are discounted on her 
next visit. Then she disappears. You wait until morning to ask your 
father where he bought her. You may be “middle class,” but that’s 
only in your parent’s house. In reality, you’re broke as shit.

Gigantic 
 
his anger blossoms like a brick 
his hand quaking to hold 
 
still 
 
he lathers his eyes and throats 
and grins 
“speak on the truth, 
 
on owning and aging wisdom 
presupposing what it is, where 
 
it's inscribed 
 
for time bares us all passage 
in our psalms and our nails  
grating us on sleepless nights 
 
so laden 
so latent 
 
until it bursts asunder all over 
reddy and ripened, like a snail.


83 
Sidhe  
 
Some last day curtained 
as light shined, and wind blew 
gently upon the whitened wood 
 
Someone stood there, beckoning 
that shadow of tomorrow’s earnings 
blessing all the trees, kissing their hands 
 
and vanished 
beneath a leaf 
 
as if summoned to explore the Otherworlds 
it relinquished its forms to dissolve in water.

Beingless Beings  
 
“The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Embalming in 
catacombs, mummies, the same idea.” 
 
— James Joyce, Ulysses, “Hades”  
 
 
There’s a wisdom to this  
book you’ve overlooked 
you, this New Age Egyptian  
 
Hallowed in your follies 
your tears veer hieroglyphic  
as they inscribe themselves 
 
Past the veil, tearing fabric 
“Nachashet ha Shamayim!  
Honored Celestial  
Serpent Queen!  
How may I serve you?” 
 
“Ciao, bello,” 
you’d hear back 
your mind extolling yourself 
of all it knew, an inky 
thought upon your brow.


85 
Beirut wa Tinit 
 
By her will, we ocean the waves within us 
into the waking world. The radiance of her 
mistaken for stillness, presages the days  
before Revelation, when the Spirit of her  
Shekhinah is most present with her Lord 
the prophet of Ma’at, speaking on Ba’alat  
and the flower of creation. Rested in her 
we are privy to the Moon before it looms 
into being on the threshold of Nun. Only  
the tick of time stirs us from the Otherworld  
we inhabit like lonely, giddy ghosts. So  
we shout to the dead, shake us yet. Let us  
anticipate the dawn that we might mine  
what the mind finds at the fringes. Stolen  
lights exude and intercede on our behalf.

Tamarru Dagun Amun 
(Or, “A Headless Youth, Palaikastro, Crete”) 
 
Indeed I have come to bring dissension  
To tear little Ba’al from Eil 
For his is a clay that I would crack 
As I am Yam before Ya-Eil— 
My scales are shown to all 
Save he who splits his cousin’s skull 
 
Alone in emptied homes and streets 
The word of Ma’at lulls unknown 
A weight is not judged  
Men receive praise despite great evil  
And I am to them their opposite: 
A triple-tongued serpent 
Kin to all creation and in this I thrive  
 
Whereupon my respected kinsmen 
You will find your prayers hollow 
Your Lords and Shekhinah exiled 
And you will not welcome them? 
As they are Kana’anim, Ponim, Philistim 
More foreign than your prophets?


87 
Io, io, io, Dios Kouros, ana Kana’anim, ho 
Delphos Surranos eimi, gar mantis eimi  
 
ki thor wa Ba’al ha Qarnayim ani. 
 
Baruchim benim ha Tinita Athirat 
ki nishmor Hokhmat ha dor ha Qadmonet 
 
Io, io, io, Starry Child, I am a Canaanite 
the son of Tyrian mothers, for I have seen 
 
for I am the bull and Lord of the Horns 
 
Blessed are the children of Tinit Athirat  
for we preserve the wisdom of the ancient Eve before us all

"Next, there is the tradition that Gaza itself was a Cretan 
foundation... called Minoa, as having been founded by 
Minos... That the people of Gaza, in Roman [or Hellenistic] 
times at least, believed in the tradition, is certain; they 
actually represented Minos on their coins." 
— Preface to G.H Hill's trans. “Life of Porphyry, Bishop of 
Gaza”


89 
Ras Melqart 
(Or, “Herakleia Minoa” cf. Gaza) 
 
It is strange to think that 
finding Sicilians amidst the ruins 
Minoans would have killed them 
 
Desecrating the land they tilled 
the serpent’s shrines they built 
still asleep beneath the bedrock 
 
O, you witless, passive Crusaders! 
how azul you stride across the field  
so reddened 
 
so whitened 
knowing only who is Amalek today 
why he is nowhere and everywhere 
 
Death becomes your mid-point 
as you try at being less than human  
when Earth has called for heart 
 
I am her message: malak mi mayim 
mayim min nahar, nahar min yamu

Marginalia 
 
The Mysteries were privatized, and dreams of civilization with them. We have drifted 
within a net of our making, kept between the bay and the tide, never seeking the sea, 
nor the ocean beyond it. 
 
If we find ourselves full, we have found a tapestry of persons bursting within. 
 
Words need at times to be purged of all they have retained. Shedding is the first death 
and the second resurrection. 
 
If be you the King, on the wandering path, what name will you take in a new town? In 
the old city, you were Tammuz. 
 
Your words shall cleave, as water sits upon a sword unsheathed, sharp in the company 
of wise things. 
 
I must cultivate a tie with the one in front of me as much as the one who precedes me. 
To be alive is to be in three places. 
 
The goddess creates you 
and to the goddess you return  
in new forms to be reborn  
on earth as it is in heaven 
 
My people have taught me tenderness toward the smallest creatures. In them I sense 
no violence, nor impulse toward sacrifice of what is most dear and pure in this world. 
 
There are twins, and they are the children of the gods, and they exist to bring the will of 
Ma’at into the world. 
 
It is through forging a relationship with a god or daimon (who is neither living nor dead) 
that one comes to understand their true psychology. 
 
We witness a transmigration of souls every night that we dream.  
 
“These mantras are missiles.”
