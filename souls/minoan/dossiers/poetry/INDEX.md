## Author's Statement

> "My poetry descends from one indigenous Wisdom tradition called by all the sacred names we know. It knows a Goddess, and her messengers who often pose as gods... By following the sounds most pleasing to Shekhinah and her Lord, Zebul Yamu, Sophet Nahar ('Divine Sea, Judge River') we explore the vestiges of ancestral worship as they were practiced in Bronze Age Mediterra."
