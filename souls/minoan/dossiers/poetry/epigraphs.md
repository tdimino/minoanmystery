## Opening Inscription

> "All that you see is all that you dream. See beyond the veil and you have seen tomorrow. Listen and you have heard the song."

## Author's Statement

> "My poetry descends from one indigenous Wisdom tradition called by all the sacred names we know.
>
> It knows a Goddess, and her messengers who often pose as gods, luring nations to their dooms with fire (that they cannot control.)
>
> By following the sounds most pleasing to Shekhinah and her Lord, Zebul Yamu, Sophet Nahar ('Divine Sea, Judge River') we explore the vestiges of ancestral worship as they were practiced in Bronze Age Mediterra; and how the privatization of Mystery coincided with the demonization of women, nature, and the dead.
>
> Chthonic may we be when we remember our names and our roots."

## Gnostic Texts

### The Holy Spirit (Concept of Our Great Power)
> "Discern what the size of water is, that it is immeasurable, incomprehensible, both its beginning and end. It supports the earth; it flows in the ether where the gods and angels dwell."

### Yeshua bin Yosef (Dialogue of the Savior)
> "If one does not understand how fire came into existence, he will burn in it, because he does not know the root of it. If one does not first understand water, he knows nothing."

### Yeshua bin Yosef (Gospel of Thomas)
> "If you bring forth that which exists within you, it will exist for you, and liberate you. If you do not bring it forth, it will exist to destroy you."

## Cyrus H. Gordon

### Evidence for the Minoan Language
> "In the fourth century A.D., Lucius Septimus recorded that in the thirteenth year of Nero, an earthquake at Knossos [Crete] exposed the interior of a tomb inscribed to Dictys, bringing to light some inscriptions. The [inscriptions] were delivered to Nero who regarded them as Phoenician and called in Semitists to interpret them."

**Significance**: Establishes the Semitic connection to Minoan Crete that underpins the collection's linguistic framework.

## Jane Ellen Harrison

### Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (p. 154-155)
> "In Crete, which was likely their home, the mysteries were open to all, they were not mysterious. The derivation from μυω, though possible, is not satisfactory.
>
> …
>
> Secrecy was not the main gist of a 'mystery': the essence of it [being] purification in order that you might safely eat and handle certain sacra."

### Themis (p. 34)
> "Mystery is a rite, a drama, enacted with magical intent."

### Themis (p. 469)
> "The god is a reflection, the projection of man's emotions socially reinforced."

**Significance**: Harrison's ritual theory—that gods emerge from collective emotion and ritual practice—provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how poetry creates/invokes divine presences.

## William Butler Yeats

### Celtic Twilight (p. 194)
> "It is natural, too, that there should be a queen to every household of them, and that one should hear little of kings, for women come more easily than man to that wisdom which ancient peoples, and all wild peoples even now, think the only wisdom.
>
> …
>
> Wisdom and beauty and power may sometimes, as I think come to those who die every day they live, though their dying may not be like the dying Shakespeare spoke of."

**Significance**: Yeats establishes the goddess-centered wisdom tradition that the collection embodies—feminine divine as primary source of mystical knowledge.
