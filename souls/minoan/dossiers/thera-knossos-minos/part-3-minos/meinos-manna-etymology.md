# Meinos and Manna: The Allotter of Portions

## Overview

The name **Minos** appears in its oldest form as **Meinos** on coins from Gaza, where the deity **Marnas** (Μαρνᾶς) was worshipped as a Zeus-like figure. This spelling preserves the original vocalism before Greek standardization, pointing to a Semitic root *m-n-n* or *m-n-h* meaning "to count, allot, apportion." The same root yields Hebrew **מָנָה** (*mānâ*, "portion, allotment"), **מָן** (*mān*, "manna"), and Arabic **Manāt** (goddess of fate/destiny). Minos as "the Allotter" fits his mythological role as Judge of the Dead—the one who assigns souls their eternal portions.

Gordon's *Minoica* (1962) identifies Linear A **mi-na-ne** with Alalakh **mi-na-an** and Ugaritic **mnn**, demonstrating the name's Bronze Age Semitic attestation. The suffix *-an* was added to the base **min-** (cf. "Min-os"), following standard West Semitic naming patterns. Isaiah 65:11 mentions a god **Meni** (מְנִי) alongside Gad (Fortune)—likely the same deity that appears as Meni in Herodotus IV:148. The Ugaritic *mnn* undergoes a characteristic n-to-š dissimilation to produce *mnš* ("present, tribute"), paralleling the shift from Manan to Manasseh.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Meinos on Gaza Coins

**Numismatic evidence**:
Coins from Gaza (4th century BCE) depict a bearded deity labeled **ΜΕΙΝΟΣ** (Meinos), seated on a throne with attributes resembling Zeus.

**Marnas cult**:
- Chief deity of Gaza in Hellenistic-Roman period
- Temple (Marneion) destroyed 402 CE
- Name possibly from Semitic *mārān* ("our lord") or connected to *manna* root

**Significance**: The spelling **Meinos** (not Minos) preserves an older vocalization. The -ei- diphthong suggests the name passed through a Semitic form before Greek adoption.

### 2. Minois: Place Southeast of Gaza

**Geographic attestation**:
A location called **Minois** (Μινωΐς) existed southeast of Gaza, reinforcing the Minos-Marnas-Gaza connection.

**Implications**: The clustering of Minos-related names around Gaza—far from Crete—suggests the name traveled with Philistine/Caphtorite populations who migrated from the Aegean to Canaan.

### 3. The M-N-N / M-N-H Root

**Semitic cognates**:

| Form | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| מָנָה (*mānâ*) | Hebrew | "portion, allotment" |
| מָן (*mān*) | Hebrew | "manna" (divine food) |
| מְנִי (*Meni*) | Hebrew | God of Destiny (Isa. 65:11) |
| *mnn* | Ugaritic | "to apportion, bestow" |
| *mnš* | Ugaritic | "present, tribute" |
| *Manāt* | Arabic | Goddess of fate |
| *minānu* | Akkadian | "to count" |

**Semantic field**: All forms cluster around the concept of counting, allotting, and distributing—precisely the function of a judge who assigns fates.

### 4. Gordon's *Minoica* (1962): Linear A Evidence

**The identification**:
Gordon connects Linear A **mi-na-ne** with:
- Alalakh **mi-na-an** (personal name in cuneiform tablets)
- Ugaritic **mnn** (the root for apportioning)

**Morphological analysis**:
- Base: **min-** (the core element)
- Suffix: **-an** (common Semitic nominal ending)
- Result: **Minos** represents the Hellenized form of **min-an**

### 5. Isaiah 65:11 — The God Meni

**The verse**:
> וְאַתֶּם עֹזְבֵי יְהוָה הַשְּׁכֵחִים אֶת־הַר קָדְשִׁי הַעֹרְכִים לַגַּד שֻׁלְחָן וְהַמְמַלְאִים **לַמְנִי** מִמְסָךְ
> "But you who forsake YHWH, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for **Gad** and fill cups of mixed wine for **Meni**..."

**Analysis**:
- **Gad** (גַּד) = Fortune/Luck
- **Meni** (מְנִי) = Destiny/Allotment

The pairing of Fortune and Destiny reflects common ancient Near Eastern divine duos. Meni as a deity of fate/destiny matches the semantic field of the *manna* root.

**Herodotus IV:148**: Mentions **Meni** among Theran colonizers—possibly preserving the theophoric element.

### 6. Ugaritic *mnn* > *mnš* Shift

**Phonological development**:
Ugaritic *mnn* ("to apportion, bestow") develops a noun form *mnš* ("present, tribute") through n-to-š dissimilation after a nasal consonant.

**Parallel**: This same shift explains **Manan → Manasseh**:
- *Manan* (the root form)
- *Manasseh* (מְנַשֶּׁה) via n-to-š dissimilation

**Ugaritic double evidence**:

> - **Lexicon.** The Ugaritic dictionaries list *mnn* 'to apportion, bestow' beside noun *mnš* 'present, tribute', illustrating exactly the n-to-š shift after a nasal.
> - **Orthography.** In several administrative tablets the same commodity appears once as *m-n-n* and elsewhere as *m-n-š*, a direct, in-corpus demonstration of the dissimilation.

**Neo-Assyrian spelling "ma-na-si-i"**:

> - The Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal vassal lists give Manasseh as *ma-na-si-i* or *ma-na-a-si*.
> - Neo-Assyrian scribes regularly flipped West-Semitic /š/ and /s/: e.g., *a-ú-se-'* = Hošea'; *yu-'a-su* = Yoaš.
> - The orthography thus preserves the nasal cluster (-na-) but shows only a single written sibilant, exactly what we expect if the source already had *ns* (phonologically one sibilant) rather than the doubled *šš* of later Hebrew spelling.

**Narrative coherence**: Linking Manasseh to "manna" coordinates Joseph's twin sons with Joseph's food-provider role: **Manasseh** → "portion," evoking God's desert ration; **Ephraim** → "double-fruitful," echoing the bumper harvest Joseph stored. The redactor's gloss "for God made me forget..." (נָשַׁנִי) then functions as a theological reinterpretation, steering the reader from a desert motif toward a personal-memory motif.

### 7. Minos as Judge of the Dead

**Homeric tradition** (*Odyssey* 11.568–571):
> "There I saw Minos, glorious son of Zeus, holding a golden scepter, judging the dead..."

**The semantic fit**: If Minos means "the Allotter," his role as Judge of the Dead is etymologically encoded. He assigns (*mānâ*) each soul its portion (*mānâ*) in the underworld—the one who counts and distributes eternal fates.

### 8. Daimon as "Divider/Allotter"

**Greek δαίμων etymology**:
The word *daimon* (δαίμων) derives from *daiomai* (δαίομαι), "to divide, distribute, allot."

**Connection**: Both Minos (*m-n-n*) and *daimon* (*dai-*) share the semantic core of allotment/distribution. Minos functions as the chief *daimon*—the supreme allotter of fates.

### 9. Nehemiah 12:44 — K-N-S + M-N-H Pairing

**The verse**:
> לִכְנוֹס בָּהֶם...מְנָאוֹת הַתּוֹרָה
> "to **gather** (*k-n-s*) into them... the **portions** (*m-n-h*)"

**Significance**: This verse pairs the roots underlying both proposed etymologies:
- **K-N-S** (gathering/assembly) → Knossos
- **M-N-H** (portions/allotment) → Minos

The co-occurrence in a single biblical verse provides a striking attestation of the semantic pairing: the gathering place (*knst*) where portions (*manna*) are distributed—precisely the administrative function of the Minoan palace.

### 10. Linear A/B Yšn / Yšr Attestations

**Astour (1965)**:
> "*Asaro*, *Atano*, *Jasano*, *Jasaro* remind us of Ugaritic *Asrn*, *Atn*, **Yšn**, **Yšr**"

Mycenaean tablet personal names show direct Ugaritic parallels, demonstrating Bronze Age onomastic exchange.

**Linear A Yashar Mana**: The reconstruction **YA-SA-SA-RA-MA-NA** as "**Yashar Mana**" (Manna the Upright) combines:
- *yšr* ("upright, righteous")
- *manna* ("allotment, portion")

This Semitic compound name would mean "Righteous Allotment" or "The Upright Apportioner"—an epithet befitting a divine judge.

**Yashar and Tzadik in Isaiah 26:7**:

| Strong's | Hebrew | English | Morphology |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|
| 734 | אֹרַח | The way | N-csc |
| 6662 | צַדִּיק | of the righteous | Adj-ms |
| 4339 | מֵישָׁרִים | is level | N-mp |
| 3477 | יָשָׁר | Most Upright | Adj-ms |
| 4570 | מַעְגַּל | the path | N-msc |
| 6662 | צַדִּיק | of the just | Adj-ms |
| 6424 | תְּפַלֵּס | You weigh | V-Piel-Imperf-2ms |

The pairing of **יָשָׁר** (yashar, "upright") with **צַדִּיק** (tzadik, "righteous/just") in Isaiah provides biblical attestation for the semantic field of *yšr*—a term applied to the path of the just and the weighing of fates.

The reconstruction of Linear A **YA-SA-SA-RA-MA-NA** as "Yashar Mana" thus gains support from Hebrew poetic parallelism, where "upright" and "just" function as near-synonyms in the context of divine judgment. *Editorial note (Tamarru):* **Mana** in this sense functions as the male counterpart to **Manāt**, pre-Islamic goddess of fate—the god who allots (*m-n-n*) to his feminine parallel who determines destiny.

### 11. Manāt in Nabataean Inscriptions: The Meccan Triad

**Nehmé** ("The Religious Landscape of North-west Arabia," 2021):

The goddess Manāt (spelled **mnwtw/mnwty** in Nabataean) appears in theophoric names unique to Northwest Arabia:

> **The Nabataeo-Arabic inscriptions show the (relative) popularity of ʾlt, ʾlʿzʾ and mnwtw. This is not particularly surprising since they are the three major goddesses of pre-Islamic Mecca.**

**Epigraphic distribution**:

| Form | Attestations | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| mnwtw | 7x | ThMNN 197, 205, 209, 221, 224, 295, 705 |
| mntw | 3x | ThMNN 278, 292, 549 |
| m[n]wt | 1x | UJadhNab 391 (scribal error for mnwt) |

**Theophoric names with Manāt** (all unique to NW Arabia):
- *hnʾmnwty* — "Manāt has favored"
- *zydmnwtw* — "Manāt has increased"
- *ʿbdmnwtw/ʿbdmnwty* — "Servant of Manāt"
- *ʿwdmnwty* — "Manāt has returned"
- *tymmnwty/tymmnwtw* — "Servant of Manāt"

**Significance**: The geographic clustering of mnwtw theophoric names in NW Arabia—absent from Petra and southern Nabataea—suggests a regional Manāt cult that preserves the *m-n-n* root in a specifically feminine divine form. The Meccan triad (Allat, Al-Uzza, Manāt) represents the Arabian transformation of West Semitic fate-goddesses, with Manāt carrying the "allotment" semantics that Minos/Meni bears in the masculine.
