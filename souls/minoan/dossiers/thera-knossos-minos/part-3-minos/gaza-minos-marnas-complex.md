# Gaza, Minos, and Marnas: The Philistine-Cretan Cult Complex

## Overview

Ancient sources preserve a striking tradition: Gaza was alternatively named **Minoa**, after the legendary Cretan king Minos. Stephanus of Byzantium and Herodianus record that Minos himself founded the city. Under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, Gaza minted coins bearing **MEINΩΣ**, depicting their claimed founder with a flowering branch—a motif Hill identified as having "a Cretan air." These same Gazans worshipped **Marnas**, whom ancient sources explicitly identify with **Zeus Cretagenes** (Cretan-born Zeus).

Edward Lipiński's 2013 study establishes a theological chain linking Marnas (the chief god of Gaza), **Dagon** (the Canaanite grain deity), and Zeus Cretagenes. Marnas is an Aramaic appellative meaning "Our Lord" (*māranā*), and his epithets identify him as a grain and rain god—precisely Dagon's function. The Gazans did not merely claim Minoan ancestry; they maintained the cult of the Cretan Zeus their ancestors brought from Caphtor, identified with the local Canaanite grain-god they found upon arrival.

## Part I: Gaza as Minoa — Historical Evidence

### 1. Ancient Testimony

**Stephanus of Byzantium** (6th c. CE, preserving earlier sources):
> "And also Gaza was called Minoa, because Minos, with his brothers Aeacus and Rhadamanthys, leaving his own [country], named it [thus]."

**Herodianus** confirms the tradition. A place called **Minois** (Μινῴς) southeast of Gaza preserves the Minos connection in local geography.

**Stephen of Byzantium on the temple**:
Gaza possessed "a temple of the Cretan Zeus, whom they called Marnes."

### 2. The MEINΩΣ Coins (2nd c. CE)

**Farhi's description** (2017):
> "On the obverse of the smallest denomination struck in Gaza under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, an armed figure appears, helmeted(?), wearing a cuirass, and holding a sceptre or spear in his left hand, and in his right, a long branch with a flower in its top. The figure is accompanied by the legend MEINΩC."

**The iconography**:
| Element | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Armed figure in military dress | Royal/sovereign authority |
| Sceptre or spear | Kingship |
| Flowering branch | Sacred tree motif (Cretan) |
| Legend: MEINΩC | Minos identification |

**Hill on the tree motif** (cited in Farhi):
> "Hill has noted that, '... the association of a founder with a tree has a Cretan air.' Cretan coins from the fifth and fourth centuries BCE presenting an image of a founder with a tree are known from Aptera."

### 3. Not "Learned Invention" but Bronze Age Memory

**Hill's defense of authenticity**:
> "In view of the overwhelming evidence which has accumulated in recent years in favour of the connexion between Crete and Philistia, it is impossible any longer to regard the legends of the relations between Gaza and Crete as a mere learned invention of late date."

**Meshorer on Bronze Age origins**:
> "The origin of the connection obviously goes back to the early history of Gaza, when 'Sea Peoples', including the Philistines, settled there, some of whom may have come from Crete."

### 4. Kerethites = Cretans (Biblical Evidence)

**LXX translations**:

| Passage | Hebrew | Greek (LXX) |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Ezekiel 25:16 | כְּרֵתִים (*Kerethim*) | Κρῆτες ("Cretans") |
| Zephaniah 2:5 | כְּרֵתִים (*Kerethim*) | Κρῆτες ("Cretans") |

**Lipiński** (2013):
> "The Septuagint translates 'Kerethites' by Krēteîtai in Ez. 25:16 and Zeph. 2:5, where the inhabitants of the Philistine Pentapolis are called 'Kerethites.'"

**Caphtor identification**:
- Amos 9:7: "Did I not bring... the Philistines from Caphtor?"
- Jeremiah 47:4: "The Philistines, the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor"

Modern scholarship identifies Caphtor (כַּפְתּוֹר) with Crete. Egyptian *Keftiu* and Akkadian *Kaptara* refer to the same region.

## Part II: The Theological Chain — Marnas = Dagon = Zeus Cretagenes

### 5. Marnas = "Our Lord" (Aramaic)

**Lipiński** (2013):
> "Friedrich Baethgen has already recognized in 1888 that Marna is an Aramaic appellative meaning 'Our Lord.'"

**Epigraphic confirmation** (Hauran inscription):
> *Annalos Kamasanou epóēse Diï Marna tō kyríō*
> "Annalos, son of Kamasanos, made (this) for Zeus Marna, the Lord."

**Etymology**:
- *mār* = "lord, master" (Aramaic)
- *-nā* = first person plural possessive ("our")
- *māranā* = "Our Lord"

Compare **1 Corinthians 16:22**: μαρανα θα (*marana tha*) = "Our Lord, come!"

### 6. Marnas as Grain and Rain God

**Lipiński on Marnas's epithets**:
> "The lexicon of Methodius and The Life of Porphyry 19 provide two Greek titles of Marna: *Zeus aldēnyos*, 'Zeus who lets grow up', and *Knous tōn ombrōn*, 'Lord of the rain showers.'"

| Title | Meaning | Function |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Zeus aldēnyos | "Zeus who lets grow up" | Vegetation growth |
| Knous tōn ombrōn | "Lord of the rain showers" | Agricultural rain |
| Marnas | "Our Lord" | General sovereignty |

### 7. Marnas = Dagon

**Lipiński's argument**:
> "Since biblical texts associate Dagon with the Philistines, while Philo of Byblos identifies Dagon with *Zeus arotrois*, 'Zeus the Plougher', and regards him as having discovered the grain and the plough, there is little doubt that Marna is Dagon."

**Dagon etymology**:
- דָּגָן (*dāgān*) = "grain, corn" (Hebrew)
- The god's name simply means "Grain"

**Dagon pre-dates the Philistines** (Lipiński):
> "The cult of Dagān / Dagon is attested in Syria from the third millennium B.C. on... Beth-Dagon, located near Jaffa, is first mentioned in a topographical list of Ramesses III, thus before the settlement of the Philistines along the Canaanite coast."

The Philistines **adopted** the local Dagon cult, then identified him with their own Cretan Zeus.

### 8. Marnas = Zeus Cretagenes

**Ancient testimony** (Lipiński):
> "The contention of Mark the Deacon and of Stephen of Byzantium, that the inhabitants of Gaza identified Marnas with Zeus Cretagenes, may be based on... the biblical tradition connecting the Philistines with Crete, ancient Caphtor."

**Why the identification?** The Gazans identified their god with Cretan Zeus because they themselves claimed Cretan ancestry. Their Marnas *was* the god their ancestors brought from Crete.

### 9. The Complete Chain

```
CRETAN ZEUS (Minoan period)
     │
     ├── Cave-born, hidden from Kronos
     ├── Annual dying-rising pattern
     └── Vegetation/fertility god
           │
           ↓
DAGON (Canaanite, 3rd millennium BCE+)
     │
     ├── דָּגָן = "Grain"
     ├── Inventor of plough/agriculture
     └── Zeus arotrois (Philo)
           │
           ↓
MARNAS (Aramaic period, 5th c. BCE+)
     │
     ├── מָרַנָא = "Our Lord"
     ├── Zeus aldēnyos ("who lets grow up")
     └── = Zeus Cretagenes (explicit identification)
```

### 10. The Minos-Marnas Connection

**Hill's suggestion** (cited in Farhi):
> "Hill suggested that there may have been a close connection in Gaza between Minos and Marnas, if indeed they were not identical."

**The "m" on Gaza's coins**: From the 5th century BCE, Gaza issued coins with the letter *m* in Aramaic script—standing for Marna, the city god. Given that the Gazans also claimed descent from **Minos** and later minted MEINΩΣ coins, the single letter may have carried intentional ambiguity:
- **M**arnas — "Our Lord," the Aramaic title
- **M**inos — the Cretan founder-king

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**MEINΩΣ coins** (Gaza, Hadrian/Antoninus Pius):
Bronze coins showing armed figure with flowering branch, legend MEINΩC.

**Hauran inscription** (Greek):
> *Diï Marna tō kyríō* — "For Zeus Marna, the Lord"

**Stephen of Byzantium** (*De Urbibus*):
Gaza = Minoa; temple of Cretan Zeus (Marnas).

**1 Samuel 5:2-7**: Philistine worship of Dagon at Ashdod.

**Ezekiel 25:16; Zephaniah 2:5** (LXX): Kerethites = Κρῆτες (Cretans).

### Archaeological Evidence

**Philistine Bichrome Ware**: Locally produced pottery with strong Aegean (LM IIIC) stylistic connections.

**Architectural features**: Hearth types and building plans at Philistine sites show Aegean parallels.
