# Manasseh and the Semitic Brothers of Minos

## Overview

The name **Manasseh** (מְנַשֶּׁה) derives from the same M-N-N root as Minos, with the characteristic Ugaritic n-to-š dissimilation that transforms *mnn* into *mnš*. Assyrian royal inscriptions transcribe the name of King Manasseh of Judah as **Mi-na-si-i** and **Mi-in-si-i**—spellings that reveal the underlying *min-* base shared with Minos. This phonological connection suggests that Manasseh and Minos are cognate names, both meaning "the one who allots/apportions."

More striking still: **all of Minos's brothers in Greek mythology bear names with plausible Semitic etymologies**. Rhadamanthys may derive from a Semitic root meaning "to rule/judge"; Sarpedon connects to Phoenician *ṣrpdn* patterns. The genealogy of Minos—son of Europa (whose name means "west" in Semitic) and Zeus—encodes a narrative of Phoenician westward expansion. Gaza coins depicting Minos with a staff, and a sacred palm on the reverse, reinforce the iconographic connection between Cretan and Canaanite sacred imagery.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Manasseh: Assyrian Transcriptions

**Cuneiform evidence**:
Assyrian royal inscriptions record the name of King Manasseh of Judah (r. 687–643 BCE) in several spellings:

| Assyrian Spelling | Normalized | Source |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Mi-na-si-i** | Minasi | Esarhaddon's vassal lists |
| **Mi-in-si-i** | Minsi | Ashurbanipal's annals |
| **Me-na-si-i** | Menasi | Variant |

**Analysis**: The Assyrian transcriptions preserve the consonantal structure **M-N-S** (from earlier **M-N-N** via dissimilation). The base **min-** matches the proposed etymology of Minos.

### 2. The N-to-Š Dissimilation

**Ugaritic pattern**:
- Root: *mnn* ("to apportion, bestow")
- Derived noun: *mnš* ("present, tribute")

The shift from *n* to *š* after a nasal consonant is a documented Semitic phonological process. This explains the development:
- **Manan** (base + suffix) → **Manasseh** (with dissimilation)
- **Minos** (Greek adaptation) preserves the un-dissimilated form

### 3. Minos's Brothers: Semitic Names

**Rhadamanthys** (Ῥαδάμανθυς):
- Possible Semitic: *r-d-m* ("to judge, rule") + theophoric suffix
- Greek tradition: Judge of the Dead alongside Minos
- Function: His judicial role matches the semantic field of "allotment"

**Sarpedon** (Σαρπηδών):
- Possible Semitic: *ṣrp* root + *-dn* suffix
- Connections to Lycian names and Phoenician patterns
- Multiple Sarpedons in myth suggest widespread name

**Europa** (Εὐρώπη):
- Semitic: *ʿereb* (ערב) = "west, evening"
- The direction of sunset; the western lands
- Europa's abduction = Phoenician westward expansion narrative

### 4. Europa and Westward Expansion

**The myth decoded**:
Zeus (in bull form) carries Europa from Phoenicia to Crete, where she bears Minos, Rhadamanthys, and Sarpedon.

**Historical substrate**:
- **Europa** = "the West" (Semitic *ʿereb*)
- **Bull** = El/Baal iconography
- **Crete** = Western destination of Phoenician expansion
- **Sons** = Colonies/settlements founded

The myth encodes Phoenician colonization: the divine power (*El/Zeus*) carrying Semitic culture (*Europa*) westward to establish new centers (*Minos* and his brothers).

### 5. Gaza Coin Iconography

**The coins**:
4th-century BCE coins from Gaza depict:
- **Obverse**: Bearded deity (Meinos/Marnas) enthroned with scepter
- **Reverse**: Sacred palm tree

**Sacred palm significance**:
- Phoenician goddess symbol (Asherah/Tanit)
- Appears on Naxos seal with female worshiper and altar
- Connects Cretan and Canaanite religious iconography

### 6. Naxos Seal: Female Worshiper and Palm

**The seal**:
A seal from Naxos depicts:
- Female figure in worshiping posture
- Sacred palm tree
- Altar

**Interpretation**: This iconography matches both Minoan priestess imagery and Phoenician cultic scenes. The palm tree—symbol of Asherah/Tanit—bridges Aegean and Levantine religious traditions.

### 7. "Male God" Seal from Crete

**The artifact**:
A Minoan seal depicting a male deity with attributes suggesting:
- Storm/sky god associations
- Possible El/Baal iconography
- Standing posture with divine implements

**Significance**: Male divine imagery in Minoan art, while less common than goddess representations, shows possible Semitic influence in depicting a supreme male deity.

### 8. Manasseh as Memory of Minos: The Caphtorite Connection

**The naming hypothesis**: The tribe of Manasseh may preserve memory of Minos/Meinos within Israelite genealogy. If both names derive from the M-N-N root ("to allot, apportion"), the patriarch Manasseh would encode Minoan/Cretan heritage within the structure of the twelve tribes.

**Caphtorite markers in Israelite tradition**:

| Element | Reference | Caphtor Connection |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Kaphtorim on the Menorah** | Exodus 25:31–36 | Ornamental "cups" (*kaphtorim*) decorating the lampstand |
| **Levites as Laos** | Niesiołowski-Spanò (2020, pp. 444–452) | Levites < Mycenaean *ra-wo* (λᾶός) = "armed men, spearmen" |
| **Kerethites (Cretans)** | 2 Samuel 8:18 | David's royal bodyguard: *ha-Kereti we-ha-Peleti* |
| **Cherethites** | 1 Samuel 30:14 | Philistine/Caphtorite territory in the Negev |

**The Levite-Laos connection**: Niesiołowski-Spanò (*Biblica* 101.3, 2020, pp. 444–452) proposes that the Levites derive from Mycenaean **\*ra-wo** (Linear B), which becomes Greek **λᾶός/λαοί** (*laos/laoi*)—originally meaning "armed men" or "spearmen" before generalizing to "people." If correct, this would make the Levites a warrior-priest caste of Aegean origin, their name preserving their Mycenaean military function.

**A speculative parallel—Menelaos** *(editorial conjecture)*: If *-laos* connects to the Levites and *Mene-* to the M-N-N root, then **Menelaos** (Μενέλαος) might hypothetically be rendered in Hebrew as **מְנִי־לָוִי** (*Meni-Lawi*)—"Portion of the Levites" or "Allotment of the Armed Host." *Note: This Menelaos connection is speculative wordplay, not a claim supported by the cited scholarship.*

**The Kerethite bodyguard**: David's elite guard consisted of **Kerethites and Pelethites** (כְּרֵתִי וּפְלֵתִי)—generally understood as "Cretans and Philistines." That the Israelite king surrounded himself with Caphtorite warriors suggests not foreign mercenaries but tribal kinsmen from the Aegean homeland.

**The Menorah's kaphtorim**: The menorah's decorative elements are called **כַּפְתֹּרִים** (*kaphtorim*)—the same word used for Caphtor (Crete). Whether ornamental "cups" or "capitals," their name embeds Cretan identity within the holiest Israelite cultic object.

**Implications**: These Caphtorite traces—the Cretan bodyguard, the Caphtor-named menorah ornaments, the mailed priesthood—are not incidental but markers of Minoan lineage within Israelite tradition. The tribe of Manasseh, bearing a name cognate with Minos, would represent the institutionalized memory of this Aegean origin.

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Genesis 41:51** (Manasseh's naming):
> וַיִּקְרָא יוֹסֵף אֶת־שֵׁם הַבְּכוֹר **מְנַשֶּׁה** כִּי־נַשַּׁנִי אֱלֹהִים אֶת־כָּל־עֲמָלִי
> "Joseph named the firstborn **Manasseh**, 'For God has made me forget (*nashshani*) all my hardship...'"

**Folk etymology as theological disowning**: The biblical text connects Manasseh to *nšh* ("to forget"), but this is secondary folk etymology—a reinterpretation designed to distance the name from its original Semitic meaning. The name's structure points to the M-N-N root with dissimilation, not the N-Š-H root.

**The Manasseh demonization**: King Manasseh of Judah (r. 687–643 BCE) is vilified in 2 Kings 21 as the worst of all Judahite kings, specifically for his Asherah worship:

> "He rebuilt the high places... erected altars for Baal and made an **Asherah**, as Ahab king of Israel had done... He set up a carved image of **Asherah** in the Temple" (2 Kings 21:3–7)

The Deuteronomistic historians blame Manasseh for Judah's eventual destruction—his sins were so grave that even Josiah's reforms could not avert divine punishment (2 Kings 23:26–27). This theological condemnation may have motivated the reinterpretation of his name: rather than "the Allotter" (a divine epithet connecting to Minos and the goddess-tradition), Manasseh becomes "the one who causes forgetting"—as if YHWH wished to forget him entirely. The folk etymology transforms a theophoric name into a mark of shame.

**Esarhaddon's Vassal Treaty** (cuneiform):
Lists **Mi-na-si-i šar Ia-ú-di** ("Manasseh king of Judah") among tributaries.

**Herodotus I.173** (on Sarpedon):
> "The Lycians originally came from Crete... led by Sarpedon..."

### Scholarly Consensus: Genesis 41:51 as Folk Etymology

**Research consensus**: The explanation in Genesis 41:51 connecting Manasseh to *naššani* ("he made me forget") is recognized as **folk etymology** (*Volksetymologie*)—a narrative/theological device, not a historical linguistic derivation.

**James Barr** (*The Semantics of Biblical Language*, 1961): "Etymology was a play on word-similarity, rather than a serious analysis of root meanings... the etymology of the men of the Bible is more a kind of poetry."

**Moshe Garsiel** (*Biblical Names: A Literary Study of Midrashic Derivations and Puns*, 1991): Biblical name explanations are "not a popular and shallow interpretation based on a lack of knowledge, but rather a deliberate deviation from the linguistic rules"—i.e., intentional literary wordplay.

**Herbert Marks** ("Biblical Naming and Poetic Etymology," *JBL* 114.1, 1995, pp. 21–42): Argues biblical authors "exploit the myth of true meaning as a generic convention"—using etymological wordplay as narrative device.

**Jeffrey L. Cooley** ("Judean Onomastic Hermeneutics in Context," *HTR* 112.4, 2019, pp. 450–479): Comprehensive survey documenting the scholarly consensus that biblical name etymologies serve theological and narrative purposes rather than linguistic accuracy.

**Implication for Manasseh**: The Genesis 41:51 connection to "forgetting" (*nšh*) is a secondary theological reinterpretation—possibly designed to distance the name from its original Minoan/Caphtorite associations with the M-N-N root ("to allot, apportion"). The true etymology points to *mnn* with n-to-š dissimilation, cognate with Minos.
