# YHWH and Cretan Zeus: The Gazan Convergence

## Overview

From Gaza comes the remarkable "YHW coin" (c. 400 BCE), depicting a Zeus-type figure with the Phoenician inscription **יהו**—the divine name of Israel's God. This same population claimed descent from Minos, worshipped Marnas (= Zeus Cretagenes), and minted coins bearing MEINΩΣ. The convergence is striking: a people who claimed Minoan ancestry depicted YHWH in the form of their ancestral Cretan Zeus.

This suggests not mere syncretism but **identification**—that for the descendants of Minos at Gaza, these were names for the same deity. David's **Cherethites** (LXX: "Cretans") may have carried this identification into Jerusalem, providing the channel through which Cretan religious traditions entered Israelite cult. The structural parallel between **Minos and Moses**—both law-givers who consulted deity in mountain/cave, both "friends of God," both paired with master craftsmen (Daedalus/Bezalel)—strengthens the case for direct transmission rather than parallel development.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The YHW Coin: YHWH in Cretan-Zeus Form

**Tyler's description** (1901):
> "There is, and has long been, in the British Museum a remarkable small silver coin, which has been spoken of as 'the Jehovah coin.' [...] On the reverse is a figure seated on what no doubt represents a chariot, though only one winged wheel is visible. This figure is easily identified with Zeus, and he bears on his hand a bird which must be regarded as the eagle, the bird of Zeus. Above the figure are three Phoenician characters corresponding to יהו."

**Date and provenance**: c. 400 BCE, attributed to Gaza.

**What the coin shows**:
- Zeus iconography (enthroned, eagle, chariot)
- YHWH theonym (יהו in Phoenician script)
- Minted at Gaza—the city of Minos's descendants

**The implication**: For whoever minted this coin, YHWH *was* Zeus. Not "like Zeus"—the same deity depicted in Greek iconographic tradition, bearing the Israelite divine name.

### 2. The Identification Chain

The evidence from Gaza presents a chain of identifications:

```
The Gazans claim descent from → MINOS
The Gazans worship → MARNAS = ZEUS CRETAGENES
The Gazans mint coins showing → YHWH as Zeus-type figure

Therefore:
MINOS (ancestor) — CRETAN ZEUS (his god) — YHWH (same god, Semitic name)
```

This is not scholarly inference but ancient self-understanding. The same population claimed Minoan ancestry, worshipped the Cretan Zeus, and depicted YHWH in Zeus form.

### 3. David's Cherethites: The Transmission Vector

**Biblical evidence**:

| Passage | Hebrew | LXX Translation |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Ezekiel 25:16 | כְּרֵתִים | Κρῆτες ("Cretans") |
| Zephaniah 2:5 | כְּרֵתִים | Κρῆτες ("Cretans") |

**Tyler on the Davidic connection** (1901):
> "It was David who engaged in the service of the Philistines under Achish... It was he who had in specially close attendance the 'Cherethite and Pelethite,' names which have been taken, not unreasonably, to denote 'Cretans and Philistines.'"

> "All this tends to lessen or remove the difficulty which would otherwise present itself as to David's introducing a foreign name into Israel."

**The transmission logic**: David's Cherethite bodyguards were Cretans—descendants of the same Minoan diaspora that settled Gaza. If the Gazans identified YHWH with Cretan Zeus, David's Cretan mercenaries would have understood YHWH as their ancestral deity under a Semitic name. They did not convert to a foreign god; they recognized their own god in Israelite worship.

### 4. Māranā and Adonai: Parallel Titular Patterns

**The Aramaic title**: Marnas = *māranā* = "Our Lord"

**Parallel with Hebrew practice**:
- Marnas = *māranā* = "Our Lord" (Aramaic)
- Adonai = *ʾădōnāy* = "My Lord" (Hebrew)

Both represent the same phenomenon: substituting a title ("Lord") for the divine name. In Hebrew, *Adonai* substitutes for the ineffable YHWH. At Gaza, *Marnas* may have functioned similarly for the Cretan Zeus/YHWH figure.

### 5. Minos and Moses: The Law-Giver Pattern

**Skipwith's "Cretan Moses"** (1904, quoting Evans):
> "'The code of Minos became the source of all later legislation. He is the Cretan Moses, who every nine years repaired to the Cave of Zeus, whether on the Cretan Ida or on Dicta, and received from the God of the Mountain the laws for his people. Like Abraham, he is described as the "friend of God." Nay, in some accounts, the mythical being of Minos has a tendency to blend with that of his native Zeus.'"

**The structural parallel**:

| Minos | Moses |
|-------|-------|
| Consulted Zeus in the cave | Received Torah on Sinai |
| Every nine years | Forty days |
| On Dicte/Ida | On the mountain of God |
| Received laws for Crete | Received commandments for Israel |
| "Friend of God" (Homer, *Odyssey* 19.179) | "Face to face" with YHWH (Exodus 33:11) |
| Built the Labyrinth (via Daedalus) | Built the Tabernacle (via Bezalel) |

### 6. The "Friend of God" Epithet

- Homer (*Odyssey* 19.179): Minos was Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής ("intimate companion of great Zeus")
- Exodus 33:11: YHWH spoke to Moses פָּנִים אֶל־פָּנִים ("face to face")
- James 2:23: Abraham was called "friend of God" (φίλος θεοῦ)

Both Minos and Moses enjoyed uniquely intimate access to the supreme deity—a relationship enabling them to transmit divine law.

### 7. The Law-Giver/Deity Conflation

In both traditions, the law-giver tends to merge with the deity whose laws he delivers:

**Minos → Zeus**:
- Skipwith: "the mythical being of Minos has a tendency to blend with that of his native Zeus"
- Minos becomes judge of the dead (Odyssey 11.568-571)—a divine function

**Moses → YHWH**:
- Exodus 4:16: "He [Aaron] shall serve as a mouth for you, and **you shall serve as Elohim** to him"
- Exodus 7:1: "See, I have made you **Elohim** to Pharaoh"
- Moses's face shines with divine radiance (Exodus 34:29-35)

### 8. Minos-Daedalus and Moses-Bezalel: The Craftsman Pattern

**Gordon's structural parallel**: The divine law-giver is paired with a master craftsman who executes the sacred architecture.

**The Cretan pair**:
- **Minos**: Receives laws from Zeus; commissions sacred structures
- **Daedalus**: Master craftsman; builds the Labyrinth, dancing floor for Ariadne

**The Israelite pair**:
- **Moses**: Receives Torah from YHWH; commissions the Tabernacle
- **Bezalel**: Master craftsman; builds the Tabernacle, Ark, sacred vessels

**Exodus 31:3** on Bezalel:
> "And I have filled him with **ruach Elohim**, with **hokhma** (wisdom), **tebuna** (understanding), and **da'at** (knowledge) in every kind of craft..."

Both the Labyrinth and the Tabernacle are sacred structures of intricate design requiring divinely-inspired craftsmanship.

### 9. Transmission, Not Parallel Development

The Cherethites who recognized their god in YHWH may also have recognized their legendary law-giver in Moses. If the Cherethites (Cretans) became the Levites (see [levite-cretan-connection.md](./levite-cretan-connection.md)), then:
- The Levitical priesthood descends from Cretan cultic personnel
- The Moses tradition descends from the Minos tradition
- YHWH inherits attributes of the Cretan Zeus

Moses did not merely resemble Minos—Moses *emerged from* the Minoan religious matrix that the Cherethites carried into Israel.
