# Asherah, the Sacred Tree, and Exile-Era Malignment

## Overview

Asherah—consort of El in Canaanite tradition, later paired with YHWH in popular Israelite religion—manifests iconographically as a sacred tree or wooden pole (*asherah*, pl. *asherim*). The Deuteronomistic historians, writing during and after the Babylonian Exile, systematically condemned Asherah-worship as the reason for Israel's catastrophe. Yet archaeological and epigraphic evidence (Kuntillet Ajrud, Khirbet el-Qom) reveals that "YHWH and his Asherah" were worshipped together well into the monarchic period.

The exile-era malignment transformed a once-legitimate goddess—"Creatrix of the gods" (*qnyt ʾilm*) in Ugaritic, "Lady Athirat of the Sea" (*rbt ʾaṯrt ym*)—into a symbol of apostasy. The bronze serpent Nehushtan, destroyed by Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4), and the asherim cut down throughout Kings and Chronicles represent the physical destruction of goddess-worship sites. What survived were traces: the sacred tree iconography that persists in Judean seals, the palm-tree of Deborah, and the "Tinit sign" in Carthaginian religion—all pointing to an earlier stratum where the divine feminine inhabited trees, poles, and serpentine forms.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Asherah in Canaanite and Israelite Religion

**Ugaritic identity** (*rbt ʾaṯrt ym*):

| Epithet | Translation | Significance |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| *rbt ʾaṯrt ym* | "Lady Athirat of the Sea" | Marine domain |
| *qnyt ʾilm* | "Creatrix of the gods" | Theogonic role |
| *ʾaṯrt rḥmy* | "Athirat of the Womb" | Maternal function |

**Israelite evidence**:
- **Kuntillet Ajrud** (8th c. BCE): "YHWH of Samaria and his Asherah" (*yhwh šmrn wʾšrth*)
- **Khirbet el-Qom** (8th c. BCE): "YHWH... and his Asherah"
- **Deuteronomy 16:21**: "You shall not plant any tree (*ʾasherah*) beside the altar of YHWH"

The prohibition itself testifies to the practice—Asherah-poles stood beside YHWH altars before Deuteronomistic reform.

### 2. The Sacred Tree as Goddess-Vessel

**Tree iconography**:
- **Judean pillar figurines**: Female form merging into trunk/pillar
- **Lachish ewer**: Sacred tree flanked by ibexes
- **Taanach cult stand**: Tree of life with goddess associations

**Biblical "Asherah" passages**:
The word *ʾăšērâ* refers to both the goddess and the cultic object:

| Reference | Context | Object |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Judges 6:25–26 | Gideon destroys | *ʾăšērâ* beside altar |
| 1 Kings 15:13 | Maacah's "abominable image" | *mipleset* for *ʾăšērâ* |
| 2 Kings 21:7 | Manasseh sets up | *pesel hāʾăšērâ* in Temple |
| 2 Kings 23:6 | Josiah removes | *ʾăšērâ* from Temple |

**Ruth Hestrin** ("The Lachish Ewer and the 'Asherah'"): "The sacred tree, as represented on the ewer, is a symbol of the goddess herself."

### 3. Nehushtan: The Bronze Serpent

**2 Kings 18:4**:
> "He [Hezekiah] removed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the *ʾăšērâ*. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent (*nəḥuštān*) that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had been making offerings to it."

**Connections**:
- **Numbers 21:8–9**: Moses makes *nāḥāš nəḥōšet* (bronze serpent) on a pole (*nēs*)
- The *nēs* (pole/standard) parallels the *ʾăšērâ* (goddess-pole)
- Serpent and tree combine in the Garden of Eden narrative (Genesis 3)

**Astour's observation**: The bronze serpent on a pole (*nēs*) functions identically to asherah-poles—vertical sacred objects receiving worship.

### 4. Exile-Era Malignment and Historical Revisionism

**Deuteronomistic agenda**:
The Deuteronomistic History (Deuteronomy through 2 Kings), compiled during Josiah's reign and revised during the Exile, interprets Israel's catastrophe through the lens of centralized YHWH-only worship:

| Reform King | Actions | Text |
|-------------|---------|------|
| Asa | Removes grandmother's *ʾăšērâ* | 1 Kings 15:13 |
| Jehoshaphat | Removes high places, *ʾăšērôt* | 2 Chronicles 17:6 |
| Hezekiah | Cuts down *ʾăšērâ*, destroys Nehushtan | 2 Kings 18:4 |
| Josiah | Full purge from Temple | 2 Kings 23:4–7 |

**Theological explanation**: The fall of Samaria (722 BCE) and Judah (586 BCE) required explanation. Asherah-worship provided the cause—retroactively, every tolerant king became complicit in the national disaster.

### 5. Tinit and Western Phoenician Asherah

**Carthaginian Tinit/Tanit**:
- Chief goddess of Carthage
- Iconography: "Sign of Tanit" (raised-arms figure), crescent, disk
- Frequently paired with Baal Hammon
- **Sacred palm trees** on votive stelae

**Hestrin**: "A palm tree symbol of the mother goddess is implied also in Judges 4:5. The presence of the sacred palm tree of Deborah in the same vicinity where there was also the Oak of Weeping of Deborah suggests the existence of at least two sanctuaries at which a Goddess Deborah was worshipped."

**Transmission**: Phoenician colonization carried Asherah-as-Tinit westward, where her tree-symbolism flourished without Deuteronomistic suppression.

### Primary Sources

**Kuntillet Ajrud inscription** (8th c. BCE):
> *brkt ʾtkm lyhwh šmrn wlʾšrth*
> "I bless you by YHWH of Samaria and by his Asherah"

**2 Kings 23:6** (Josiah's reform):
> וַיֹּצֵא אֶת־הָאֲשֵׁרָה מִבֵּית יְהוָה מִחוּץ לִירוּשָׁלַ‍ִם
> "And he brought out the *ʾăšērâ* from the house of YHWH, outside Jerusalem..."

**Judges 4:5** (Deborah's palm):
> וְהִיא יוֹשֶׁבֶת תַּחַת־תֹּמֶר דְּבוֹרָה
> "And she sat under the palm tree of Deborah"

### Scholarly Support

**Ruth Hestrin** ("Sacred Tree on Palestine Painted Pottery"): "The tradition of the burial of Deborah at the foot of the tree implies close associations of the tree with the goddess."

**William Dever** (*Did God Have a Wife?*, 2005): Comprehensive archaeological argument for Asherah as YHWH's consort in popular Israelite religion.
