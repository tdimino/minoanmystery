# Asherah, the Sacred Tree, and Exile-Era Malignment

## Overview

Asherah—consort of El in Canaanite tradition, later paired with YHWH in popular Israelite religion—manifests iconographically as a sacred tree or wooden pole (*asherah*, pl. *asherim*). The Deuteronomistic historians, writing during and after the Babylonian Exile, systematically condemned Asherah-worship as the reason for Israel's catastrophe. Yet archaeological and epigraphic evidence (Kuntillet Ajrud, Khirbet el-Qom) reveals that "YHWH and his Asherah" were worshipped together well into the monarchic period.

The exile-era malignment transformed a once-legitimate goddess—"Creatrix of the gods" (*qnyt ʾilm*) in Ugaritic, "Lady Athirat of the Sea" (*rbt ʾaṯrt ym*)—into a symbol of apostasy. The bronze serpent Nehushtan, destroyed by Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4), and the asherim cut down throughout Kings and Chronicles represent the physical destruction of goddess-worship sites. What survived were traces: the sacred tree iconography that persists in Judean seals, the palm-tree of Deborah, and the "Tinit sign" in Carthaginian religion—all pointing to an earlier stratum where the divine feminine inhabited trees, poles, and serpentine forms.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Asherah in Canaanite and Israelite Religion

**Ugaritic identity** (*rbt ʾaṯrt ym*):

> For the full Athirat epithets table with KTU references, see [divine-feminine-toponyms.md](./divine-feminine-toponyms.md#4-athirat-sea-goddess-and-mother-of-the-gods).

Key epithets: *rbt ʾaṯrt ym* ("Lady Athirat of the Sea"), *qnyt ʾilm* ("Creatrix of the gods"), *ʾaṯrt rḥmy* ("Athirat of the Womb").

**Israelite evidence**:
- **Kuntillet Ajrud** (8th c. BCE): "YHWH of Samaria and his Asherah" (*yhwh šmrn wʾšrth*)
- **Khirbet el-Qom** (8th c. BCE): "YHWH... and his Asherah"
- **Deuteronomy 16:21**: "You shall not plant any tree (*ʾasherah*) beside the altar of YHWH"

The prohibition itself testifies to the practice—Asherah-poles stood beside YHWH altars before Deuteronomistic reform.

### 2. The Sacred Tree as Goddess-Vessel

**Tree iconography**:
- **Judean pillar figurines**: Female form merging into trunk/pillar
- **Lachish ewer**: Sacred tree flanked by ibexes
- **Taanach cult stand**: Tree of life with goddess associations

**Biblical "Asherah" passages**:
The word *ʾăšērâ* refers to both the goddess and the cultic object:

| Reference | Context | Object |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Judges 6:25–26 | Gideon destroys | *ʾăšērâ* beside altar |
| 1 Kings 15:13 | Maacah's "abominable image" | *mipleset* for *ʾăšērâ* |
| 2 Kings 21:7 | Manasseh sets up | *pesel hāʾăšērâ* in Temple |
| 2 Kings 23:6 | Josiah removes | *ʾăšērâ* from Temple |

**Ruth Hestrin** ("The Lachish Ewer and the 'Asherah'"): "The sacred tree, as represented on the ewer, is a symbol of the goddess herself."

### 3. Nehushtan: The Bronze Serpent

**2 Kings 18:4**:
> "He [Hezekiah] removed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the *ʾăšērâ*. He also broke in pieces the bronze serpent (*nəḥuštān*) that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had been making offerings to it."

**Connections**:
- **Numbers 21:8–9**: Moses makes *nāḥāš nəḥōšet* (bronze serpent) on a pole (*nēs*)
- The *nēs* (pole/standard) parallels the *ʾăšērâ* (goddess-pole)
- Serpent and tree combine in the Garden of Eden narrative (Genesis 3)

**Astour's observation**: The bronze serpent on a pole (*nēs*) functions identically to asherah-poles—vertical sacred objects receiving worship.

### 4. Exile-Era Malignment and Historical Revisionism

**Deuteronomistic agenda**:
The Deuteronomistic History (Deuteronomy through 2 Kings), compiled during Josiah's reign and revised during the Exile, interprets Israel's catastrophe through the lens of centralized YHWH-only worship:

| Reform King | Actions | Text |
|-------------|---------|------|
| Asa | Removes grandmother's *ʾăšērâ* | 1 Kings 15:13 |
| Jehoshaphat | Removes high places, *ʾăšērôt* | 2 Chronicles 17:6 |
| Hezekiah | Cuts down *ʾăšērâ*, destroys Nehushtan | 2 Kings 18:4 |
| Josiah | Full purge from Temple | 2 Kings 23:4–7 |

**Theological explanation**: The fall of Samaria (722 BCE) and Judah (586 BCE) required explanation. Asherah-worship provided the cause—retroactively, every tolerant king became complicit in the national disaster.

### 5. Tinit and Western Phoenician Asherah

**Carthaginian Tinit/Tanit**:
- Chief goddess of Carthage
- Iconography: "Sign of Tanit" (raised-arms figure), crescent, disk
- Frequently paired with Baal Hammon
- **Sacred palm trees** on votive stelae

**Hestrin**: "A palm tree symbol of the mother goddess is implied also in Judges 4:5. The presence of the sacred palm tree of Deborah in the same vicinity where there was also the Oak of Weeping of Deborah suggests the existence of at least two sanctuaries at which a Goddess Deborah was worshipped."

**Transmission**: Phoenician colonization carried Asherah-as-Tinit westward, where her tree-symbolism flourished without Deuteronomistic suppression.

### 6. Athirat of the ʿIlb-Tree: South Arabian Parallel

**Frantsouzoff** ("A Minaic inscription on the pedestal of an ibex figurine from the British Museum," 2006):

A Minaic inscription (5th–4th c. BCE) from ancient Yemen invokes **ʾTRTʿlb** ("Athīrat of the ʿilb-tree"), providing the first attestation of sacred tree worship in ancient South Arabia:

> On the contrary, in the paganism of north and central Arabia trees were often considered as deities' incarnations or probably as their places of abode. It is enough to remember the famous story about the sacred tree of the goddess **al-ʿUzza** in the valley of Nakhla, which was cut by Khālid b. al-Walīd by the Prophet's order (Ibn al-Kalbī 1969: 18–21). In one version of it this kind of tree is not specified (*šajarah*) but, according to the other, she resided in one of three gum-acacia trees (*talāt samurāt*). When Khālid came to destroy the third one, he saw a dreadful Abyssinian woman, killed her, then killed the custodian of her cult (*sādin*) and cut down the tree.

> In the Bible **ʾăšērâ** is attested as the proper noun of the Canaanite goddess (Asherah) and as a common noun (sometimes with the article *hā-* or even in the plural: **ʾăšērôt** and **ʾăšērîm**), which designates a cult object of this deity: "probably a stylised tree, or a lopped trunk" (Wyatt 1995: col. 187). Deuteronomy 16:21, for instance, strongly prohibits the planting of such a tree: "Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God..." (*lōʾ-tittaʿ lé-kā ʾăšērâ kol-ʿēṣ ʾēṣel mizbah YHWH ʾĕlōhê-kā*).

> Therefore the Mishnah interprets Asherah simply as a tree (*ʿAbōdâ Zārâ* 3:7). It should be emphasised that, "the distinction between deity and cult object is ultimately not an ancient, but a modern one" (Wyatt 1995: col. 191).

> **In the expression *ʾTRTʿlb* the *ʿilb*-tree should be understood as an abode of the goddess Athīrat or as her incarnation. In that case a close parallel with the veneration of Asherah is striking. For the first time not only the names of two deities, South Arabian and West Semitic, but also some elements of their cult prove to be distinguished by such a similarity.**

**Significance**: The Minaic inscription demonstrates that Athīrat/Asherah's association with sacred trees extended beyond Canaan into the Arabian Peninsula, preserving goddess-tree theology that Deuteronomistic reform suppressed in Israel.

### 7. The Arabian Goddess Triad: Allat, Al-Uzza, and Stellar Iconography

**Steiner** ("The Goddess and the Copper Snake: Metallurgy, Star-Lore and Ritual," 2016):

The Arabian goddess Al-Uzza and her counterpart Allat represent Venus as morning and evening star—dual wives of the moon god:

> **The Nabataean DuShara's (a name related to "sa'ir", which is the Land of Se'ir, but it also means hairy/goat/ibex and is also another name for Esau, who dwelt in Se'ir) partner was Al-Uzza or Allat, whose two names reflect again the two Venus wives of the moon, as personifications of the morning and evening stars.**

**The goddess figure in star-lore**:

Steiner identifies an ankh-like goddess figure with outstretched arms appearing in Negev rock art, positioned to separate winter and summer constellations—a celestial goddess presiding over the agricultural calendar crucial to nomadic survival.

**Herodotus on Allat** (III.8):

The earliest Greek testimony identifies Allat with the celestial goddess Ourania:

> Διόνυσον δὲ θεῶν μοῦνον καὶ **τὴν Οὐρανίην** ἡγέονται εἶναι... ὀνομάζουσι δὲ τὸν μὲν Διόνυσον Ὀροτάλτ, τὴν δὲ **Οὐρανίην Ἀλιλάτ**.
>
> "They believe in only two gods: Dionysus and the Heavenly One (*Ourania*)... they call Dionysus 'Orotalt' and the Heavenly One '**Alilat**' (Allat)."

**Alpass** (*The Religious Life of Nabataea*, 2013):

The Temple of the Winged Lions at Petra has been identified as Allat's sanctuary:

> "Thus we conclude that the supreme goddess of the 'Temple of the Winged Lions' was **Allat**, in borrowed attributes and aspects..."

The Sanctuary of Allat at Iram (Savignac excavations 1933–34) provides additional archaeological evidence for Allat's widespread worship in the Nabataean sphere.

### 8. Goddess as Kingmaker: From Ugarit to Knossos

The goddess consecrates male kingship in Ugaritic, Mycenaean, and Minoan traditions.

**Athirat proclaims Ba'al as king** ("Creation at Ugarit and in the Old Testament"):

> Thus the text probably began with a standard formula pronounced by the goddess Asherah saying, *w' rbt aṯrt ym*, 'and Lady Asherah of the Sea answered'. Then she says, "'Thy word, O El, is wise' (51:V:41). This is followed by the very important announcement, *mlkn aliy[n] b'l ṯpṭn w'in d'lnh*, **"Our king is Aliyn Baal, Yea, our judge, and there is no one who is above him."**
>
> Hence, in text 68 Baal wins his kingship and in text 51 it is proclaimed.

**The Mountain Mother sealing** (Peatfield, "The Topography of Minoan Peak Sanctuaries"):

> The so-called **'Mountain Mother' sealing** from Knossos is also dated to LM II [Mycenaean, post-Thera eruption]. This sealing shows a female figure on a hill, flanked by heraldic lions. **She hands a staff to a larger male figure** who holds one hand to his forehead (a gesture of worship). This scene is interpreted by Rutkowski as the goddess of the peak sanctuaries **endowing the king with her divine authority and power**, to be her earthly representative.
