# Classical Sources and Spartan Colonial Bias

## Overview

The Greek literary record on Thera—Herodotus, Pindar, Apollonius Rhodius, and Pausanias—transmits not neutral historiography but politically motivated narratives serving Spartan and Cyrenaean dynastic interests. Herodotus's account of Thera's foundation (Histories IV.147–150) traces the island's settlers to Sparta via the Minyans, establishing a genealogical claim that justified Spartan hegemonic pretensions in the Aegean. Pindar's Cyrenaean odes (Pythian 4 and 5) celebrate the Battiad dynasty by linking their ancestry to Euphemos, the Argonaut who received a clod of Libyan earth at Thera—a charter myth legitimizing Cyrene's royal house.

These sources tend to minimize or subordinate the island's Phoenician-Canaanite substrate to Greek genealogical claims. Herodotus himself admits that Membliaros (whom he calls a Phoenician kinsman of Cadmos) preceded the Greek colonizers (IV.147), yet this acknowledgment is buried beneath layers of Hellenic genealogical assertion. Apollonius's *Argonautica* preserves the Euphemos clod myth in its most elaborate form, complete with cosmogonic imagery ("the Pall of Darkness") that Astour identifies as Phoenician in origin. Reading these sources critically requires distinguishing between genuine Bronze Age memory and Iron Age political fabrication.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Herodotus on Thera's Foundation (IV.147–150)

**The Spartan claim**:
Herodotus presents Thera's colonization as part of a Spartan expansion narrative:

> "Theras, son of Autesion and grandson of Polyneices, was appointed regent for his nephews, the sons of Aristodemus... When his nephews came of age, Theras led a colony to the island, which was thenceforth called Thera after him."

**The suppressed Phoenician presence**:
Earlier in the same passage, Herodotus admits:

> "Cadmos, son of Agenor, touched at this island in his search for Europa, and left there—whether because he liked the country, or for some other reason—a number of Phoenicians, including **Membliaros**, his own kinsman."

**The tension**: Herodotus acknowledges that Phoenicians preceded Greeks on Thera by multiple generations, yet his narrative centers Spartan agency. The island's name supposedly derives from the Spartan regent Theras—overwriting whatever the Phoenicians called it.

### 2. Pindar's Cyrenaean Odes: Legitimizing Battiads

**Pythian 4** (462 BCE):
The longest of Pindar's odes, celebrating Arkesilas IV of Cyrene. The myth of Euphemos structures the entire poem:

| Element | Pindaric Treatment | Political Function |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Euphemos receives clod | Prophetic moment at Lake Triton | Links Argonautic past to Battiad present |
| Clod washed into sea | Prophecy of delay | Explains 17-generation gap |
| Thera as waystation | "Sacred root of great Cyrene" | Thera sanctified as Battiad origin |
| Apollo's guidance | Divine sanction | Royal house has divine mandate |

**Pythian 5** (462 BCE):
Reinforces the same charter myth, praising Arkesilas as descendant of divinely appointed kings.

**Political context**: Arkesilas IV was the last Battiad king, facing internal unrest. Pindar's odes served as propaganda, anchoring shaky legitimacy in mythological deep time.

### 3. Apollonius Rhodius and the "Pall of Darkness"

The *Argonautica* IV.1694–98 describes the Argonauts encountering the "Pall of Darkness" (*νὺξ ὀλοή*) near Crete—a passage Astour interprets as preserving memory of the Theran eruption's ash cloud.

> For the full passage and Astour's cosmogonic analysis, see [primordial-waters-tehom-tiamat.md](./primordial-waters-tehom-tiamat.md#4b-the-pall-of-darkness-astours-cosmogonic-analysis).

**Euphemos clod myth** (Argonautica IV.1731–64):
Apollonius elaborates the clod prophecy that Pindar invokes. The god Triton gives Euphemos a clod of Libyan earth at Lake Triton; had Euphemos thrown it into the sea near Taenarum, his descendants would have colonized Libya within four generations. Instead, the clod washes from the ship at Thera, delaying the prophecy seventeen generations.

**Function**: This myth explains why Cyrene's founders came via Thera, not directly from Sparta—an aetiological narrative that requires Thera as an intermediate sacred site.

### 4. Pausanias on Spartan-Theran Relations

**Description of Greece III.1.7–8**:
Pausanias transmits the Spartan version of Theran colonization, echoing Herodotus. He emphasizes the Heraclid (Dorian) lineage of Theras and notes the cult relationships between Sparta and Thera.

**Laconian bias**: Pausanias, writing in the 2nd century CE, drew heavily on Spartan local traditions. His account of Thera reinforces the Dorian colonization narrative without acknowledging Phoenician precedent.

### 5. What the Sources Suppress

**Phoenician-Canaanite elements subordinated to Greek genealogy**:

| Element | Evidence | Greek Treatment |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Membliaros as founder | Herodotus IV.147 | Mentioned, then ignored |
| Semitic place-names | Astour's etymologies | Hellenized beyond recognition |
| Kadmean alphabet | Herodotus V.58 | Attributed to Phoenicians, then naturalized |
| Cultic continuity | Archaeological (sanctuaries) | Interpreted as "Greek" |
| Volcanic memory | Apollonius's Pall of Darkness | Preserved but not explained |

**The Spartan interest**: In the Archaic and Classical periods, Sparta claimed leadership over Dorian Greeks. Establishing genealogical links to Aegean islands supported Spartan hegemonic rhetoric. Cyrene's wealth (from silphium trade) made the Battiad alliance valuable.

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Herodotus IV.147** (Phoenicians at Thera):
> "Cadmos... left in this island, among other Phoenicians, his own kinsman Membliaros."

**Herodotus IV.150** (Spartan foundation):
> "They sent colonists to the island, from Lacedaemon itself and from the perioecic towns... Theras himself was their leader."

**Pindar, Pythian 4.17–22** (Thera as mother-city):
> κεῖνος ὄρνις ἐκτελευτάσει μεγαλᾶν πολίων / ματρόπολιν Θήραν γενέσθαι
> "That omen shall bring it to pass that Thera become the mother-city of great cities"

**Pindar, Pythian 4.33–38** (The divine clod):
> δεξιτερᾷ προτυχὸν ξένιον μάστευσε δοῦναι. / οὐδ᾿ ἀπίθησέ νιν, ἀλλ᾿ ἥρως ἐπ᾿ ἀκταῖσιν θορών, / χειρί οἱ χεῖρ᾿ ἀντερείσαις / δέξατο βώλακα δαιμονίαν.
> "He sought to give a guest-gift from his right hand. The hero did not disobey, but leaping onto the shore, placing hand in hand, he received the divine clod."

**Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica IV.1731–35** (Clod gift):
> "Then Triton lifted up a clod of earth and gave it to the hero as a guest-gift..."

### Scholarly Support

**Astour, Michael C.** ("Greek Names in the Semitic World," 1964): First systematic argument that Greek sources on Thera preserve Semitic etymologies beneath Hellenic overlay.

**Malkin, Irad** (*Myth and Territory in the Spartan Mediterranean*. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994): Demonstrates how Spartan colonization myths served political functions, legitimizing territorial claims through genealogical manipulation. See especially chapters 2–3 on Thera-Cyrene and Dorian identity construction.

**Dougherty, Carol** (*The Poetics of Colonization: From City to Text in Archaic Greece*. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993): Analyzes how Greek foundation narratives (including Cyrene's) constructed colonial legitimacy through mythological charter. See especially chapter 4 on Pindar's Pythian 4.
