# Primordial Waters: Tehom, Tiamat, and Volcanic Memory

## Overview

The Hebrew **תְּהוֹם** (*tehôm*, "the deep") of Genesis 1:2—hovering beneath the darkness before creation—shares cognate status with Akkadian **Tiamat**, the primordial sea-goddess defeated by Marduk in *Enuma Elish*. Both derive from a common Semitic root *\*tihām-* designating the cosmic abyss. This linguistic kinship carries theological weight: the chaos-waters represent a pre-creation state that must be subdued, divided, or ordered for the cosmos to emerge.

The Theran eruption (c. 1628–1500 BCE) inscribed itself into Aegean cultural memory as precisely such a chaos-event: the sea boiling, darkness descending, the boundary between water and land catastrophically violated. When West Semitic colonists named the island Kalliste ("most beautiful") and later Thera, they may have encoded the goddess Athirat—who bears the epithet *Athirat Rahmay* ("Athirat of the Womb/Mercy")—into the volcanic landscape. The phonetic shift from *Athirat* → *Thera* follows documented patterns of initial vowel loss in Greek renderings of Semitic names.

This dossier traces the theological vocabulary of primordial chaos across Mesopotamian, Canaanite, and early Hebrew traditions, proposing that Thera's naming participates in this deep cosmological grammar.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Tehom and Tiamat: Cognate Status

**Genesis 1:2** (MT):
> וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי **תְהוֹם** וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם

"And the earth was formless and void, and darkness was upon the face of **Tehom**, and **ruach Elohim** hovered over the face of the waters."

**Linguistic analysis**:

| Language | Term | Form | Root |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Hebrew | *tehôm* | Noun, usually without article | *\*t-h-m* |
| Akkadian | *tiāmtu* / *tâmtu* | "sea" (common noun) | *\*t-h-m* |
| Akkadian | *Tiāmat* | Goddess name | *\*t-h-m* + divine marker |
| Ugaritic | *thm* | "deep, ocean" | *\*t-h-m* |
| Arabic | *tihāma* | Coastal lowland (Tihama) | *\*t-h-m* |

The shared Semitic root *\*t-h-m* designates salt-water oceanic depths. Hebrew *tehôm* appears without the definite article in most occurrences (36 of 37), suggesting it retained traces of a proper-name quality—the personified Deep.

### 2. Tiamat in Enuma Elish

**Tablet I** establishes the primordial state:
> "When on high the heaven had not been named, firm ground below had not been called by name, naught but primordial **Apsû**, their begetter, and **Tiamat**, she who bore them all, their waters commingling as a single body..."

**Tablet IV** describes Marduk's victory:
> "He split her like a shellfish into two parts: half of her he set up and ceiled as sky, pulled down the bar and posted guards."

The cosmogonic pattern: chaos-waters must be divided for creation. This matches Genesis 1:6–7 (dividing waters above from waters below) without direct mythological combat.

### 3. Tiamat Beyond Enuma Elish

Tiamat appears in non-combative contexts:

**Lexical lists**: *tiāmtu* simply means "sea" in administrative and literary texts, without cosmic significance.

**Theogonic contexts**: Tiamat as mother-goddess, generative rather than adversarial. The *Enuma Elish* combat tradition represents one strand of a more complex tradition.

**Athirat Rahmay**: The Ugaritic sea-goddess Athirat bears the epithet "of the Womb" (*rḥm*), connecting generative waters with maternal imagery—a parallel to Tiamat's role as "she who bore them all."

### 3a. Athirat Visits El at the THMTM: The Ugaritic Deep

A crucial link between Athirat and the Tehom/Tiamat tradition appears in the Baal Cycle, where **Athirat travels to El's dwelling at the THMTM**—the Ugaritic cognate of Hebrew *tehom* and Akkadian *Tiamat*:

**KTU 1.4 IV 20-24**:
> "Then she [Athirat] sets her face towards El at the source of the two rivers, at the core of the source of the abyss (*thmt*). She makes her way to El's cave and enters the dwelling of the king, the Father of Years."

This formula recurs throughout the Baal Cycle (KTU 1.2 III 4-5, KTU 1.3 v 6-7, KTU 1.6 I 32-37).

Per Lu (2018, UCLA dissertation *The Deification and Demonization of Tĕhôm*):
> "The texts of The Birth of the Beautiful Gods (1.23:30), The Baal Cycle, and Aqhat (1.17 vi 12, 48; 1.19 i 45) repeat the same description of *thmt* as 'the convergence of two deeps.' Just as ancient Mesopotamia's deity Ea/Enki builds his dwelling above the *apsu* (after defeat of the deity Apsu in the Enuma Elish tradition), so we can understand **El's dwelling above the convergence of the Deeps as his enthronement or rule over the waters**."

**Key evidence for THMTM as deified entity**:
- **Deity lists** (RS 24.643 / KTU 1.148): THMTM receives ram sacrifices alongside other gods
- **Paired with Mountains**: Multiple texts (RS 1992.2004, RS 26.142) formulaically pair "the deity of Mountains with the deity of Deep Waters"—a cosmic merism

This means "Lady Athirat of the Sea" (*rbt aṯrt ym*) is **geographically and mythologically bound to the Ugaritic cognate of Tiamat/Tehom**—the primordial deep where El holds court.

### 4. Volcanic Memory and Chaos Narratives

The Theran eruption produced:

| Phenomenon | Mythological Encoding |
|------------|----------------------|
| Pyroclastic darkness | "Pall of Darkness" (Apollonius) |
| Tsunami waves | "Deep" rising, boundary violations |
| Ash clouds blocking sun/moon | "Stars pierced not that fatal night" |
| Caldera collapse | Waters overwhelming land |

**Transmission hypothesis**: Witnesses to the eruption—Minoan, Phoenician, and early Greek—encoded the experience in cosmogonic vocabulary. The Membliaros tradition (primordial dark waters) localized precisely at Anaphe-Thera may preserve this volcanic memory.

### 4a. Archaeological Evidence: Çeşme-Bağlararası (2021)

The mythological encodings of volcanic chaos find archaeological confirmation at **Çeşme-Bağlararası**, a western Anatolian coastal settlement where the **first and only human victim** of the Theran eruption was discovered (Şahoğlu et al., *PNAS* 2021).

**The Site**: A thriving coastal settlement with **Minoan cultural elements** (Late Minoan IA pottery), functioning as a regional trade hub. The site shows evidence of both land and sea commerce connecting the Anatolian coast to Crete.

**Key Findings**:

| Evidence | Significance |
|----------|-------------|
| **"Çeşme Man"** | Articulated young male skeleton within tsunami debris—the only preserved eruption victim ever found |
| **Dog skeleton** | Died in doorway; articulated animal in non-burial context is a tsunami marker |
| **Ash layer matching Santorini "Bo"** | Chemical fingerprint (XRF, neutron activation) confirms Theran origin |
| **Four tsunami deposits (H1a–d)** | Multiple waves over hours to weeks; fires burning at sea between waves |
| **Rescue pits above victim** | Survivors dug but couldn't retrieve bodies buried under heavy stones (>40cm) |
| **Century-long abandonment** | The settlement **ceased to exist for at least a century** after the disaster |

**Chronological Constraint**:
Radiocarbon dating from nine samples constrains the eruption to **no earlier than 1612 BCE**:
> "The sample closest to the human skeleton (OxA-38858; Cal BCE 1612 to 1573 [19.4%] and Cal BCE 1565 to 1501 [76.1%]) would be the most representative of the event's age."

**Minoan Trade Network Collapse**:
> "Sea-borne trade at the time of the event was central to the vitality and power of societies, in particular the sea-dominating Minoans. The social fallout from the destruction of the system's core infrastructure (ships, harbors, ports, and coastal settlements) cannot be understated."

**Compound disaster effects**: Debris-strewn harbors rendered unusable; volcanic ash altered soil chemistry; contaminated aquifers; damaged crops; demographic shifts across the Aegean.

This evidence confirms that the "chaos-event" encoded in texts like Apollonius's "Pall of Darkness" reflects **historical catastrophe**—not merely cosmogonic metaphor. The compound disaster reshaped Mediterranean civilization for generations, and may explain why cosmogonic vocabulary attached itself to the Thera region.

### 4b. The "Pall of Darkness": Astour's Cosmogonic Analysis

Michael Astour (*Hellenosemitica*, 1965, pp. 119–121) provides the definitive scholarly treatment of the "Pall of Darkness" passage in Apollonius Rhodius's *Argonautica* (IV.1694–98):

> "But straightway as they sped over the wide Cretan sea night scared them, that night which they name the **Pall of Darkness**: the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams of the moon, but **black chaos descended from heaven**, or haply some other darkness came, **rising from the nethermost depths**."

Astour argues this passage preserves authentic **Phoenician cosmogonic vocabulary**:

> "This forceful description, so unlike the general, rather slack style of Apollonios, does not have an ordinary tempest as its subject... It sounds like a highly poetic solemn cosmogonic myth, extraordinarily resembling Gen. I:2 and Philo of Byblos... The fragment speaks for itself; it operates with such notions, sacralized by liturgic tradition, as 'black chaos' and 'darkness rising from the nethermost depths,' which reminds one of 'the dark air' and 'the obscure, Erebos-like chaos' of Philo, and '**darkness upon the face of the Deep**' of Gen. I:2."

### 5. Athirat Rahmay and the Womb Connection

Ugaritic texts give Athirat (ʾaṯrt) several epithets—*rbt ʾaṯrt ym* ("Lady Athirat of the Sea"), *ʾaṯrt rḥmy* ("Athirat of the Womb/Mercy"), and *qnyt ʾilm* ("Creatrix of the gods").

> For the full epithets table with KTU references, see [divine-feminine-toponyms.md](./divine-feminine-toponyms.md#4-athirat-sea-goddess-and-mother-of-the-gods).

The *rḥm* root connects to both "womb" and "mercy/compassion" (cf. Hebrew *raḥamîm*). Athirat's sea-womb generates the divine pantheon—a Canaanite parallel to Tiamat's generative role.

**Athirat → Thera**: If Thera encodes Athirat via initial vowel loss (documented pattern: *Aššur* → *Syria*, *ʾilat* → *Eilat*), the island's name would mean "place of the Sea-Goddess."

### 6. Job 7:12: Yam, Tannin, and Divine Surveillance

Job 7:12 provides the most explicit biblical synthesis of chaos-combat imagery, uniquely combining **Yam** (Sea), **Tannin** (sea-dragon), and **mišmār** (surveillance/guard) in a single rhetorical question:

> הֲיָם־אָ֭נִי אִם־תַּנִּ֑ין כִּֽי־תָשִׂ֖ים עָלַ֣י מִשְׁמָֽר
> "Am I Yam or Tannin, that you set a **watch** (*mišmār*) over me?" (Job 7:12)

**Diewert** ("Job 7:12: yām, Tannîn and the Surveillance of Job," *JBL* 106, 1987):

> "It is not the combination of yam and tannîn that is peculiar to Job 7:12, since they are also linked in Ugaritic and biblical texts (PRU II.3; CTA 3.3.35–37; Ps 74:13–14), but rather **the application of mišmār to both these creatures**."

> "Yam and tannîn are mythological enemies of God and potential forces of chaos who threaten the cosmos and therefore must be kept under **constant surveillance**."

**Ugaritic parallel (CTA 3.3.35–37)**: Anat's victory speech listing Yam and Tannin together as defeated enemies:
> "Did I not crush Il's Darling, Sea? Nor destroy River, the great god? Nor muzzle (*ʾištbm*) Tannin full well?"

**Enuma Elish connection**: Tablet IV.139–140 describes Marduk posting guards over Tiamat's waters after her defeat—the same **surveillance** motif that Job invokes:
> "Half of her he set up and ceiled as sky, **pulled down the bar and posted guards**. He bade them to allow not her waters to escape."

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Genesis 1:2** (Hebrew Bible):
The *tehôm* appears as pre-creation reality, not as defeated enemy. **Ruach Elohim** "hovers" (*meraḥepet*) over the waters—a generative, incubating image.

**Enuma Elish IV.135–140** (Akkadian):
> "The lord trod on the legs of Tiamat, with his unsparing mace he crushed her skull... He split her like a shellfish into two parts."

**KTU 1.4 IV.49** (Ugaritic, Baal Cycle):
> "Message of Lady Athirat of the Sea (*rbt ʾaṯrt ym*), word of the Creatrix of the gods (*qnyt ʾilm*)..."

**Apollonius Rhodius, *Argonautica* IV.1694–98**:
The "Pall of Darkness" passage—cosmogonic vocabulary applied to the Cretan sea near Thera.

### Scholarly Support

**Hermann Gunkel** (*Schöpfung und Chaos*, 1895): First systematic argument for Genesis 1 depending on Mesopotamian chaos-combat mythology, though without direct literary dependence.

**Cyrus Gordon**: Noted that Ugaritic *thm* serves as cognate bridge between Akkadian Tiamat and Hebrew *tehôm*.

**Astour**: Connected Membliaros ("waters without light") to Phoenician cosmogony, demonstrating cosmogonic vocabulary at Thera.
