## Part I: Thera — Dossiers

### 1. `membliaros-cadmean-etymology.md`
**Scope**: Astour's Semitic interpretation of Membliaros (מם־בלי־אר), Cadmean/Phoenician theophoric naming patterns, connection to Baal tradition.

**Key concepts**:
- מם = "from/of"
- בלי = "Baal"
- אר = "light/fire"
- Cadmus as Phoenician founder figure
- Poikiles, Euphemos etymologies (Astour 1964)

### 2. `primordial-waters-tehom-tiamat.md`
**Scope**: Hebrew Tehom / Akkadian Tiamat / Greek Thera volcanic-mythological connection. Theran eruption as encoded cosmic chaos memory.

**Key concepts**:
- Tehom (Genesis 1:2) cognate with Tiamat
- Tiamat in Enuma Elish and non-EE texts
- Volcanic memory in flood/chaos narratives
- Athirat Rahmay = Athirat/Tiamat womb connection

### 3. `divine-feminine-toponyms.md`
**Scope**: Islands and cities named after goddesses — Aegina, Kythera (Kotharot), Eilat, Astaroth Qarnaim, Beth Anath. Rabbat Hawwat Eilat as Carthaginian chief goddess. Tinit = Western Phoenician Asherah. Initial A-loss in Greek renderings of Semitic names.

**Key concepts**:
- Aegina the nymph
- Kythera < Kotharot (divine midwives)
- Eilat < *ʾilat* (goddess)
- Rabbat Hawwat Eilat (Great Eve of Eilat)
- Tinit/Tanit iconography, palm trees
- **Initial vowel aphaeresis** (Rosół 2013; van der Poel 2019):
  - Akkadian *Aššur* → Greek *Συρία* (Syria) — **Çineköy inscription** (8th c. BCE bilingual Luwian-Phoenician) proves Luwian *su-ra/i* = Phoenician *ʾšr*; now scholarly consensus (Frye 1992, Rollinger 2006)
  - Phoenician *ʔal-gal* → Greek *γέλγῑς* (garlic) — initial ʔ (aleph) + vowel lost
  - Persian *akīnákēs* → Greek variant *kīnákēs* "sword" (Schmitt, Iranica)
  - Hebrew *yāšp* (יָשְׁפֶה) → Greek *ἴασπις* (jasper) — initial y- glide lost (Rosół; agreed by Masson, Beekes)
- **Scholarly note**: Rosół (2013) identifies 65 direct Semitic loans but "refrains from discussing the vowel phonemes" because Semitic writing systems inadequately reproduce vowels
- **Athirat → Thera** via same phonetic pattern (loss of initial unstressed vowel)

### 4. `ya-wa-eil-yamu.md`
**Scope**: Ya wa Eil as title of Yamu (Sea God), evidence from Ba'al Cycle, Abiyam etymology, Song of the Sea (Exodus 15). Ya prefix patterns in Semitic terms.

**Key concepts**:
- Yamu in Ugaritic mythology
- *yw ʾil* invocation formula
- Abiyam (אֲבִיָּם) = "my father is Yam"
- Song of the Sea echoes
- **Ya prefix in Semitic terms** (theophoric element)

### 5. `murex-paur-paur-textile.md`
**Scope**: Kythera as oldest murex site, Linear B "paur-paur" < Semitic *pʾr* (beauty/glory), Aaron's robes, Cretan priestess saffron tassels, Rabbinic continuity. Semitic reduplication patterns.

**Key concepts**:
- **Kuthira** — Astour's rendering in "Aegean Place Names in Egyptian" (1966) supports Kotharot → Kythera etymology; variant spelling suggests Minoan dialect may have preserved *Kuthirat* (= Kotharot)
- **Athirat connection**: Kuthira/Kythera pronunciation influenced by both Kotharot (divine midwives) and Athirat (goddess), reinforcing dual divine-feminine substrate
- Murex trunculus / brandaris
- Blue (tekhelet), purple (argaman)
- Saffron golden-red
- פאר (pʾr) in biblical texts
- Priestly garment traditions
- **Repetition of Semitic root for emphasis** (paur-paur pattern)
- Repetition of *kol* for emphasis
- *soqeq soqeq* reduplication
- Hebrew term repetition for emphasis

## Part II: Knossos — Dossiers

### 8. `potnia-daboritu-baalat-deborah.md`
**Scope**: Potnia Daboritu (oldest labyrinth form) < Ba'alat Daborat/Deborah. Melissa/melissae myths, Prophetess Deborah, Minoan bee imagery. Medusa etymology.

**Key concepts**:
- Linear B da-pu₂-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja
- Deborah (דְּבוֹרָה) = "bee"
  - "The name Deborah signifies a bee, and the Canaanite mythology may have been influenced by Hittite myths, for it was the humble bee who in the Hittite mythology was sent by the Lady of the Gods to search for Telepinu." (Hestrin, "Sacred Tree on Palestine Painted Pottery")
- Judges 4-5 (Prophetess)
  - "A palm tree symbol of the mother goddess is implied also in Judges 4:5. The presence of the sacred palm tree of Deborah in the same vicinity where there was also the Oak of Weeping of Deborah suggests the existence of at least two sanctuaries at which a Goddess Deborah was worshipped in the Canaanite cults of an earlier period." (Hestrin)
- **Deborah's burial at sacred tree**: "The tradition of the burial of Deborah at the foot of the tree implies close associations of the tree with the goddess." (Hestrin)
- Melissae priestesses
- Minoan bee pendants, Malia
- **Medusa < M-D-S root** (treading underfoot, threshing, pressing Earth)
- Demeter connection (oversees threshing/agricultural rites)
- **Demeter's temples called megara; megaron = Semitic loan**

### 9. `knossos-knossot-gathering-place.md`
**Scope**: Knossos etymology (Astour: possibly *knossot* with lost final -t), palace as egalitarian gathering place, ceremonial academy for priestesses. Extensive Semitic assembly terminology parallels.

**Key concepts**:
- Knossos < *knst* (gathering?)
- Palace as sacred precinct
- Temple-palace hybridity
- Female initiation traditions
- Skoteino cave, peak sanctuaries as peculiarly Minoan cult sites. "Few, if any, caves on the mainland can be shown to have witnessed cult in Mycenaean times." "The traditions connected with chthonic cave cult did, however, tenaciously survive into historic times and generally in the cult of Demeter."
- **Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos**: On Gypsadhes hill, just south of the palace complex (550–330 BCE). "Excavation reports note the comingling of Minoan remains and Hellenistic deposits" — suggesting cult continuity. (Coldstream 1973, *Knossos: The Sanctuary of Demeter*)
- **Homeric Hymn to Apollo**: "Strangers, who dwelt aforetime round **wooded Cnossus**" — Apollo addressing Cretan sailors whom he brings to Delphi as his priests
- **Rendsburg Black Athena etymologies** (multiple Cretan terms)
- **Dikte / Diqqatu** connection
- Cretan women wearing Linear A tablets
- **Kenishta di Qadusha** (Aramaic "Holy Assembly")
- **Kinnusha** in Proverbs
  - Proverbs, like the Zohar, are part of an oral tradition stretching back to remote antiquity
  - The ultimate age of a single saying or passage could conceivably go back to the dawn of time and human speech
- Shekhinah dwells wherever there is assembly
- **Biblical K-N-S passages** (only verb forms appear in the Bible):
  - **Esther 4:16**: לֵךְ כְּנוֹס אֶת־כָּל־הַיְּהוּדִים הַנִּמְצְאִים בְּשׁוּשָׁן וְצוּמוּ עָלַי — "Go, **assemble** all the Jews who live in Shushan, and fast in my behalf"
  - **Psalm 33:7**: כֹּנֵס כַּנֵּד מֵי הַיָּם נֹתֵן בְּאוֹצָרוֹת תְּהוֹמוֹת — "[God] **heaps up** the ocean waters like a mound, stores the deep in vaults"
  - **Nehemiah 12:44**: לִכְנוֹס בָּהֶם לִשְׂדֵי הֶעָרִים **מְנָאוֹת** הַתּוֹרָה לַכֹּהֲנִים וְלַלְוִיִּם — "to **gather** into them from the fields of the towns the **portions** prescribed by the Teaching for the priests and Levites"
    - Note: מְנָאוֹת (*menaot*, "portions") from root M-N-H — connects K-N-S (gathering) with allotment/distribution
- **Mishnah — first attestation of noun כְּנֶסֶת**:
  - **Pirkei Abot 1:1**: "וּנְבִיאִים מְסָרוּהָ לְאַנְשֵׁי כְנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה" — "and the prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly (Knesset HaGedolah)"
- Minyan (quorum of ten)
- **Tyrannion of Antioch as Tyrannos** (Semitic title transmission)
- **Kenos in Ecclesiastes 3:5**: "עֵת לְהַשְׁלִיךְ אֲבָנִים וְעֵת כְּנוֹס אֲבָנִים" (a time to cast stones, a time to gather stones)
  - *kenos* (כְּנוֹס) = infinitive construct form
  - **Phonological match**: The sheva (ְ) under the כ in the construct form is an ultra-short or effectively silent vowel, producing the consonant cluster **kn-** that maps directly to Greek **Κν-** in Κνωσός

### 10. `rendsburg-cretan-etymologies.md`
**Scope**: Rendsburg's Black Athena etymologies for Cretan/Greek terms with Semitic origins. Comprehensive phonetic correspondence methodology.

**Key concepts**:
- **Dikte** < Akkadian *diqqatu* (small/fine)
- Mt. Dikte as sacred mountain
- Linear A Semitic substrate
- Cretan women wearing Linear A tablets (votive?)
- **Megara** < Semitic *mʿārâ* "cave" (vowels match exactly)
- **naos** "temple" < Semitic *nāweh* "abode"
- **bomos** "altar" < Semitic *bamah* "high place"
- **Kabeiroi** < Semitic *kabir* "great"
- **kudos** "divine glory" < Semitic *qdš* "holy"
- **sophia** "wisdom" < Egyptian *sb3/sb3yt* "teaching"
- **chrysos** "gold" < Semitic *ḥrṣ*
- **nektar** < Semitic *niqṭr* "incense"
- **gaia/gē** "earth" < Semitic *gayʾ/gēʾ* "valley"
- **haima** "blood" < Phoenician *ḥayyim* "life"
- Phonetic correspondence rules (ḥ → h, ḥ → χ, q → k)
- "Pater/padre" principle: variable correspondences across borrowing periods

## Part III: Minos — Dossiers

### 11. `meinos-manna-etymology.md`
**Scope**: Minos's oldest form "Meinos" (Gaza coins), Marnas worship, *manna/manan* root shared with Arabic Manat, Minos as Judge of Dead, destiny/allotment concept.

**Key concepts**:
- Gaza coin iconography
- **Minois** (place SE of Gaza)
- Marnas (Gazan deity)
- Manat (Arabic goddess of fate)
- מָן (manna), מָנָה (portion/allotment)
- M-N-S / M-N-N in Ugaritic
- **Root of Daimon as "Divide:Allot"** (δαίμων < δαίομαι)
- **Gordon "Minoica" (1962)**: Linear A **mi-na-ne** = Alalakh **mi-na-an** = Ugaritic **mnn**; suffix *-an* added to base **min** (cf. "Min-os"); parallel in Isa. 65:11 as god **"Meni"** (cf. Meni in Herodotus IV:148)
- **Ugaritic mnn > mnš shift**: Ugaritic *mnn* "to apportion, bestow" → noun *mnš* "present, tribute" — n-to-š dissimilation after nasal (same as Manan → Manasseh)
- **Nehemiah 12:44 לִכְנוֹס...מְנָאוֹת** (*liknos...menaot*): "to **gather** (*k-n-s*) ... the **portions** (*m-n-h*)" — K-N-S gathering + M-N-H allotment co-occur in single verse, linking Knossos and Minos etymologies¹
- **Linear B Yšn / Yšr attestations** (Astour 1964): "*Asaro*, *Atano*, *Jasano*, *Jasaro* remind us of Ugaritic *Asrn*, *Atn*, **Yšn**, **Yšr**" — Mycenaean tablet personal names with direct Ugaritic parallels
- **Linear A Yashar Mana**: YA-SA-SA-RA-MA-NA = "**Yashar Mana**" (Manna the Upright) — Semitic name reconstruction connecting *yšr* ("upright/righteous") with *manna* ("allotment/portion")

¹ **Footnote**: The co-occurrence of K-N-S (gathering/assembly) and M-N-H (portions/allotment) in Nehemiah 12:44 provides a biblical attestation of the semantic pairing underlying the Knossos-Minos compound: the gathering place (*knst*) where portions (*manna*) are distributed — precisely the administrative function of the Minoan palace.

### 12. `manasseh-semitic-brothers.md`
**Scope**: Manasseh < same M-N-N root (Assyrian transcriptions), all Minos's brothers have Semitic names, Gaza coin staff + tree iconography, sacred palm iconography.

**Key concepts**:
- Manasseh (מְנַשֶּׁה)
- Assyrian royal inscriptions
- Rhadamanthys, Sarpedon etymologies
- Minoan sanctuary coins
- **Gaza coin: Minos with staff, sacred palm on reverse**
- Naxos seal: female worshiper, sacred palm, altar

### 13. `kouretes-diktaean-young-god.md` *(consolidated)*
**Scope**: CONSOLIDATED dossier combining Kouretes initiation, Megistos Kouros = Ba'al Rapu, Palaikastro Hymn, and Diktaean Zeus dying-rising god pattern.

**Key concepts**:
- Kouretes as initiatory band; Harrison's daimones of the Golden Age
- **Megistos Kouros** = Ba'al Rapu (Astour); divine youth as "Allotter" (cf. δαίμων < δαίομαι)
- **Palaikastro Hymn**: "Greatest Kouros... come to Dicte for the year"
- Dying-rising god pattern (Adonis, Osiris, Tammuz parallels)
- Corybantes = Kouretes = Kabbirim
- **Ya of Dikte was appointed** (divine appointment motif)
- Thunder-rites and shield-clashing
- Young god cult (Cretan Zeus)
- **Minos as Chief Daimon** — linked to dying-rising cycle
- **Peak sanctuaries**: "Peak sites continued to be frequented on Crete until historic times."
