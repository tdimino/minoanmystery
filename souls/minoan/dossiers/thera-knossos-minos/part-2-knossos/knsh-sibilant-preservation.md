# KNŠ: The Older Sibilant

## Overview

The standard assumption treats Aramaic **כנש** (KNŠ, "to gather") as a dialect variant of Hebrew **כנס** (KNS), implying that the shin (שׁ) is secondary and the samekh (ס) is original. This dossier inverts that assumption: **KNŠ preserves the older sibilant /š/**, while Hebrew KNS is the innovation.

The evidence converges from four independent lines:

1. **Egyptian transcription** — Astour (1966) shows KU-NU-**SHA** ends in Semitic "true" shin, not samekh
2. **Akkadian cognates** — Paul (1996) documents *kamāsu*, *kannušu*, and *kiništu*, all with /š/ reflexes
3. **Areal linguistics** — Mańczak (1988) and Steiner (2005) provide the theoretical framework: peripheral/archaic forms can preserve what central innovations replace
4. **Zoharic/Targumic attestation** — כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא preserves /š/ in living liturgical usage

If KNŠ is the older sibilant, then **Knossos** (Egyptian KU-NU-SHA) preserves a Bronze Age Semitic form that Hebrew later modified — and the Aramaic mystical tradition unknowingly maintained the original pronunciation of the Minoan Gathering Place.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Egyptian KU-NU-SHA: The Oldest Transcription

The Egyptian topographic list of Amenhotep III (c. 1390–1352 BCE) records Cretan place names in a script that Astour calls "phonetically (so far as consonants are concerned) greatly superior to Linear B."

> "We have now the name of Knossos written in a script which is phonetically (so far as consonants are concerned) greatly superior to *Linear B*. We see that its first consonant corresponds to Egyptian *k* (= Semitic kaph), and its last, to Egyptian *sh* (= Semitic 'true' shin)."
> — Astour, "Aegean Place-Names in an Egyptian List" (1966)

**The critical point**: Egyptian *sh* transcribes Semitic shin (שׁ), not samekh (ס). The scribes who rendered Knossos into Egyptian hieroglyphs heard — and recorded — a final sibilant that was /š/, not /s/.

Linear B, by contrast, cannot distinguish between sibilants at all. The Egyptian transcription is therefore the **only** Bronze Age witness to the exact quality of this consonant, and it testifies unambiguously to /š/.

Astour further notes that this sibilant pattern matches the Egyptian transcriptions of the Sea Peoples: *ʾA-qi-ya-wa-**sha***, *Tu-ru-**sha***, *Sha-k(a)-ru-**sha***, *Wa-**sha**-**sha***. The Aegean sibilant was consistently heard as shin by Egyptian scribes.

### 2. Paul's KMS → KNS → KNŠ Chain, Reframed

Shalom Paul (1996) established that the Hebrew hapax legomenon כָּמוּס (*kāmūs*, Deut 32:34, "stored, gathered") is cognate with Akkadian *kamāsu* ("to gather"), a widely attested verb. He then argued that Hebrew KNS is a later form of KMS, citing the well-known m/n interchange in Semitic:

> "The interchange of *m* and *n* both within various Semitic languages and between them is known if not overly frequent."
> — Paul, "Three Related Roots: KMS, KNS and KNŠ" (1996), p. 35

Paul's examples of the m/n interchange include:
- Hebrew שׂטם/שׂטן (*śṭm/śṭn*, "to hate")
- Akkadian *bašmu* / Ugaritic *bṭn* / Hebrew *ptn* ("serpent")
- Galilean Aramaic: *ʾdm > ʾdn* ("man"), *drwm > drwn* ("south"), *ḥkym > ḥkyn* ("wise")

Paul treated KMS → KNS → KNŠ as a linear diachronic chain, with each form deriving from the previous. But this can be reframed: **KMS and KNŠ may be sister cognates from a common proto-form**, not a parent-child chain. The parallel is Ugaritic, where the roots MNN and MNŠ coexist as variant reflexes of the same semantic field — neither derives from the other; both descend from a common ancestor with nasal-conditioned sibilant variation.

On this model, the proto-root *\*K-M/N-Š* ("to gather") yielded:
- Akkadian *kamāsu* (preserving /m/ and /s/)
- Aramaic *kənāš* (preserving /š/, shifting /m/ > /n/)
- Hebrew *kānas* (shifting both: /m/ > /n/, /š/ > /s/)

Hebrew, not Aramaic, is the most innovative form.

### 3. Neo-Assyrian *kannušu* and Neo-Babylonian *kiništu*

Paul documents two cuneiform forms that independently attest the /š/ sibilant:

**kannušu** (Neo-Assyrian D-form): "to gather in harvest"
> "AHwb col. 436b lists this verb under *kanāšu* II and takes it as an Aramaism. This is open to discussion."
> — Paul, fn. 9

The Assyriological dictionaries (AHw) classify *kannušu* under *kanāšu* — a root with shin, not samekh. Whether this is an Aramaism or an independent Akkadian form, it proves the /š/ sibilant was present in Mesopotamian cuneiform sources.

**kiništu** (and by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu*, *kinartu*): Neo-Babylonian and Late Babylonian term for a priestly class or college.

> "the frequently used loan-word *kiništu* — and its by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu* and *kinartu* — used in Neo-Babylonian and Late Babylonian text for a priestly class."
> — Paul, p. 39

Paul notes that AHw translates this as *Priesterkollegium* ("priestly college"), while the CAD renders it as "class of priests of a low status." The etymological meaning is transparent: the *kiništu* is the "gathering" — the assembled priestly body. This is the direct ancestor of Aramaic כְּנִשְׁתָּא (*kenishtā*) and, ultimately, of Hebrew כְּנֶסֶת (*knesset*).

Paul is emphatic that the standard lexica have the direction of borrowing wrong:

> "*HALAT* 461b seems to imply that Mishnaic Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic *kns* are borrowed from Aramaic *knš*, and that *keneset* is borrowed from *kēništā*. Both assertions are patently absurd. At the most one may assert that *kns* is a 'blend' of the original Hebrew *kms* with Aramaic *knš*."
> — Paul, fn. 25

The irony: Paul himself may understate the antiquity of KNŠ. If *kiništu* was already a standard institutional term in Neo-Babylonian (7th–4th c. BCE), and if Neo-Assyrian *kannušu* is attested even earlier, then the /š/ form circulated across Mesopotamia centuries before the earliest Hebrew attestations of KNS.

### 4. Zoharic כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא (Kenishta Qadishta)

The Zohar, though redacted in medieval Spain, transmits Aramaic terminology rooted in much older priestly and mystical traditions. The term **כְּנִשְׁתָּא** (*kenishtā*, "gathering/assembly") appears repeatedly with the /š/ sibilant intact:

> **Zohar I, 33b:** "Rabbi Yehuda said: When the Qadosh Barukh Hu (קָדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא) wishes to enter the Kenishta (כְּנִשְׁתָּא), He first looks at the Kenishta, and only then does He enter."

> **Zohar II, 135a:** "And they are called the Kenishta Qadisha (כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישָׁא, 'holy gathering'), the Kenishta of the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה). When they join together, they are called the Kenishta of Qedusha (קְדוּשָׁה)."

> **Zohar III, 19a:** "Therefore, wherever a Kenishta (כְּנִשְׁתָּא) is found, the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה) dwells."

The Targumic tradition independently preserves the same form:

> **Targum Proverbs 1:20:** "Chokmeta (חָכְמְתָא, 'Wisdom') sings in the streets; in the Kinnusha (בְּכִנּוּשָׁא, 'gathering') she raises her voice."

These are not archaizing affectations. The Aramaic-speaking Jewish communities that produced the Targumim and transmitted the mystical traditions behind the Zohar used כְּנִשְׁתָּא as their *natural* word for "assembly" — the same word that Neo-Babylonian scribes rendered as *kiništu* a millennium earlier. The /š/ sibilant persisted unbroken in Aramaic from the Bronze Age through Late Antiquity and into the medieval period, while Hebrew alone innovated to /s/.

### 5. Steiner: Against Uniformity Assumptions

Richard Steiner's study of spirantization in Aramaic and Hebrew (2005) provides the theoretical license for treating KNŠ and KNS as independent regional reflexes rather than borrowings in one direction or another.

Steiner's central argument:

> "Like all ancient historians, those of us who deal with the history of ancient languages are dependent on chance discoveries for the data with which we work. We are faced with enormous gaps in the historical record, and we compensate for them by making simplifying assumptions — assumptions that favor uniformity over variation."
> — Steiner, "Variation, Simplifying Assumptions, and the History of Spirantization in Aramaic and Hebrew" (2005), p. 52

> "We should never forget that each simplifying assumption that we employ increases the tenuousness of our conclusions."
> — Steiner, p. 53

Steiner demonstrates that spirantization — the shift of stops to fricatives in begadkephat consonants — did not occur at the same time or in the same way across all Semitic-speaking communities. Samaritan Hebrew, for example, never spirantized velars (k, g), while Tiberian Hebrew did. The assumption that a phonological change attested in one region can be projected uniformly onto all regions is, in Steiner's term, part of a "gentleman's agreement" — "a tacit understanding among scholars" that has never been rigorously tested.

**The implication for KNŠ/KNS**: If spirantization varied by region and period, so could sibilant shifts. Aramaic speakers preserving /š/ while Hebrew speakers shifted to /s/ need not imply borrowing — it may reflect independent retention of an older form in one community and innovation in another.

### 6. Mańczak/Bartoli: Conservative Periphery Theory

Witold Mańczak (1988) tested Matteo Bartoli's famous "second norm" of areal linguistics against quantitative Romance language data and proved it statistically valid:

> **Bartoli's Second Norm**: "If one of two linguistic stages is found in peripheral areas and the other in a central area, the stage occurring in the peripheral areas is usually the earlier one."

Mańczak's generalization eliminates the need to define "peripheral" and "central":

> "If phenomenon B occurs in one area and phenomenon A occurs in more than one area, phenomenon A usually is older than phenomenon B, and the probability that phenomenon A is an archaism is larger, the larger the number of areas where A occurs."
> — Mańczak, "Bartoli's Second 'Norm'" (1988), p. 78

**Application to KNŠ/KNS**:

| Sibilant | Attestation Areas |
|----------|-------------------|
| /š/ (KNŠ) | Egyptian transcription (KU-NU-SHA), Neo-Assyrian (*kannušu*), Neo-Babylonian (*kiništu*), Aramaic (*kenishtā*), Zoharic/Targumic (*kenishtā*, *kinnushā*) |
| /s/ (KNS) | Hebrew alone (*kānas*, *kenos*, *knesset*) |

By Mańczak's generalized criterion, the form attested in **more areas** is usually the older one. KNŠ with /š/ appears across five independent attestation contexts spanning two millennia and three language families; KNS with /s/ appears in Hebrew alone. The probability is overwhelming: **KNŠ is the archaism, KNS is the innovation.**

---

## Synthesis: Knossos as KNŠ

If the original sibilant was /š/, then the name **Knossos** (Egyptian KU-NU-SHA) preserves a Bronze Age form *\*Kənuš-* or *\*Knuš-* meaning "Gathering Place" — with the same sibilant that Aramaic maintained and Hebrew replaced.

The trajectory:
- **Bronze Age**: *\*K-N-Š* ("to gather") — attested in Egyptian transcription of Knossos
- **1st millennium BCE**: Akkadian *kiništu* (priestly assembly), *kannušu* (harvest gathering)
- **Late antiquity**: Aramaic כְּנִשְׁתָּא — synagogue, sacred assembly
- **Hebrew innovation**: כְּנֶסֶת — the same word, with /š/ shifted to /s/
- **Medieval preservation**: Zoharic כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא — Holy Assembly, /š/ intact

The Zohar's "Kenishta Qadishta" is not an archaism by accident. It preserves, through unbroken Aramaic transmission, the same sibilant that Egyptian scribes heard in the name of the Minoan palace-sanctuary three thousand years earlier.

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Egyptian topographic list of Amenhotep III** (c. 1390–1352 BCE):
Entry 7: *Ku-nu-sha* = Knossos. Egyptian *sh* = Semitic "true" shin.

**Deuteronomy 32:34** (Hebrew Bible):
> הֲלֹא־הוּא **כָּמֻס** עִמָּדִי חָתֻם בְּאוֹצְרֹתָי
> "Is not this **stored** (*kāmūs*) with me, sealed in my storehouses?"

The unique Biblical attestation of KMS — the earliest stratum of the root, cognate with Akkadian *kamāsu*.

**Akkadian** (*The Poor Man of Nippur*):
> *ikmis ana quppima // iktanak kišippiš*
> "He gathered them into a cage, sealed it with a seal."

*kamāsu* in parallelism with *kanāku* ("to seal") — the same semantic pairing as Hebrew KMS // ḤTM in Deut 32:34.

**Neo-Babylonian administrative texts**:
*kiništu* (and by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu*, *kinartu*) — priestly assembly class.

**Zohar II, 135a**:
> כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישָׁא... כְּנִשְׁתָּא דִּשְׁכִינָה
> "Kenishta Qadisha... Kenishta of the Shekhinah"

**Targum Proverbs 1:20**:
> חָכְמְתָא... בְּכִנּוּשָׁא
> "Chokmeta... in the Kinnusha (gathering)"
