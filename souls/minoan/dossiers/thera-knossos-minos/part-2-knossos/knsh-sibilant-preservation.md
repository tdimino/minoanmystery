# KNŠ: The Older Sibilant

## Overview

The standard assumption treats Aramaic **כנש** (KNŠ, "to gather") as a dialect variant of Hebrew **כנס** (KNS), implying that the shin (שׁ) is secondary and the samekh (ס) is original. This dossier inverts that assumption: **KNŠ preserves the older sibilant /š/**, while Hebrew KNS is the innovation.

The evidence converges from four independent lines:

1. **Egyptian transcription** — Astour (1966) shows KU-NU-**SHA** ends in Semitic "true" shin, not samekh
2. **Akkadian cognates** — Paul (1996) documents *kamāsu*, *kannušu*, and *kiništu*, all with /š/ reflexes
3. **Areal linguistics** — Mańczak (1988) and Steiner (2005) provide the theoretical framework: peripheral/archaic forms can preserve what central innovations replace
4. **Zoharic/Targumic attestation** — כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא preserves /š/ in living liturgical usage

If KNŠ is the older sibilant, then **Knossos** (Egyptian KU-NU-SHA) preserves a Bronze Age Semitic form that Hebrew later modified — and the Aramaic mystical tradition unknowingly maintained the original pronunciation of the Minoan Gathering Place.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Egyptian KU-NU-SHA: The Oldest Transcription

The Egyptian topographic list of Amenhotep III (c. 1390–1352 BCE) records Cretan place names in a script that Astour calls "phonetically (so far as consonants are concerned) greatly superior to Linear B."

> "We have now the name of Knossos written in a script which is phonetically (so far as consonants are concerned) greatly superior to *Linear B*. We see that its first consonant corresponds to Egyptian *k* (= Semitic kaph), and its last, to Egyptian *sh* (= Semitic 'true' shin)."
> — Astour, "Aegean Place-Names in an Egyptian List" (1966)

**The critical point**: Egyptian *sh* transcribes Semitic shin (שׁ), not samekh (ס). The scribes who rendered Knossos into Egyptian hieroglyphs heard — and recorded — a final sibilant that was /š/, not /s/.

Linear B, by contrast, cannot distinguish between sibilants at all. The Egyptian transcription is therefore the **only** Bronze Age witness to the exact quality of this consonant, and it testifies unambiguously to /š/.

Astour further notes that this sibilant pattern matches the Egyptian transcriptions of the Sea Peoples: *ʾA-qi-ya-wa-**sha***, *Tu-ru-**sha***, *Sha-k(a)-ru-**sha***, *Wa-**sha**-**sha***. The Aegean sibilant was consistently heard as shin by Egyptian scribes.

### 2. Paul's KMS → KNS → KNŠ Chain, Reframed

Shalom Paul (1996) established that the Hebrew hapax legomenon כָּמוּס (*kāmūs*, Deut 32:34, "stored, gathered") is cognate with Akkadian *kamāsu* ("to gather"), a widely attested verb. He then argued that Hebrew KNS is a later form of KMS, citing the well-known m/n interchange in Semitic:

> "The interchange of *m* and *n* both within various Semitic languages and between them is known if not overly frequent."
> — Paul, "Three Related Roots: KMS, KNS and KNŠ" (1996), p. 35

Paul's examples of the m/n interchange include:
- Hebrew שׂטם/שׂטן (*śṭm/śṭn*, "to hate")
- Akkadian *bašmu* / Ugaritic *bṭn* / Hebrew *ptn* ("serpent")
- Galilean Aramaic: *ʾdm > ʾdn* ("man"), *drwm > drwn* ("south"), *ḥkym > ḥkyn* ("wise")

Paul treated KMS → KNS → KNŠ as a linear diachronic chain, with each form deriving from the previous. But this can be reframed: **KMS and KNŠ may be sister cognates from a common proto-form**, not a parent-child chain. The parallel is Ugaritic, where the roots MNN and MNŠ coexist as variant reflexes of the same semantic field — neither derives from the other; both descend from a common ancestor with nasal-conditioned sibilant variation.

On this model, the proto-root *\*K-M/N-Š* ("to gather") yielded:
- Akkadian *kamāsu* (preserving /m/ and /s/)
- Aramaic *kənāš* (preserving /š/, shifting /m/ > /n/)
- Hebrew *kānas* (shifting both: /m/ > /n/, /š/ > /s/)

Hebrew, not Aramaic, is the most innovative form.

### 3. Neo-Assyrian *kannušu* and Neo-Babylonian *kiništu*

Paul documents two cuneiform forms that independently attest the /š/ sibilant:

**kannušu** (Neo-Assyrian D-form): "to gather in harvest"
> "AHwb col. 436b lists this verb under *kanāšu* II and takes it as an Aramaism. This is open to discussion."
> — Paul, fn. 9

The Assyriological dictionaries (AHw) classify *kannušu* under *kanāšu* — a root with shin, not samekh. Whether this is an Aramaism or an independent Akkadian form, it proves the /š/ sibilant was present in Mesopotamian cuneiform sources.

**kiništu** (and by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu*, *kinartu*): Neo-Babylonian and Late Babylonian term for a priestly class or college.

> "the frequently used loan-word *kiništu* — and its by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu* and *kinartu* — used in Neo-Babylonian and Late Babylonian text for a priestly class."
> — Paul, p. 39

Paul notes that AHw translates this as *Priesterkollegium* ("priestly college"), while the CAD renders it as "class of priests of a low status." The etymological meaning is transparent: the *kiništu* is the "gathering" — the assembled priestly body. This is the direct ancestor of Aramaic כְּנִשְׁתָּא (*kenishtā*) and, ultimately, of Hebrew כְּנֶסֶת (*knesset*).

Paul is emphatic that the standard lexica have the direction of borrowing wrong:

> "*HALAT* 461b seems to imply that Mishnaic Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic *kns* are borrowed from Aramaic *knš*, and that *keneset* is borrowed from *kēništā*. Both assertions are patently absurd. At the most one may assert that *kns* is a 'blend' of the original Hebrew *kms* with Aramaic *knš*."
> — Paul, fn. 25

The irony: Paul himself may understate the antiquity of KNŠ. If *kiništu* was already a standard institutional term in Neo-Babylonian (7th–4th c. BCE), and if Neo-Assyrian *kannušu* is attested even earlier, then the /š/ form circulated across Mesopotamia centuries before the earliest Hebrew attestations of KNS.

### 4. Zoharic כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא (Kenishta Qadishta)

The Zohar, though redacted in medieval Spain, transmits Aramaic terminology rooted in much older priestly and mystical traditions. The term **כְּנִשְׁתָּא** (*kenishtā*, "gathering/assembly") appears repeatedly with the /š/ sibilant intact:

> **Zohar I, 33b:** "Rabbi Yehuda said: When the Qadosh Barukh Hu (קָדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא) wishes to enter the Kenishta (כְּנִשְׁתָּא), He first looks at the Kenishta, and only then does He enter."

> **Zohar II, 135a:** "And they are called the Kenishta Qadisha (כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישָׁא, 'holy gathering'), the Kenishta of the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה). When they join together, they are called the Kenishta of Qedusha (קְדוּשָׁה)."

> **Zohar III, 19a:** "Therefore, wherever a Kenishta (כְּנִשְׁתָּא) is found, the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה) dwells."

The Targumic tradition independently preserves the same form:

> **Targum Proverbs 1:20:** "Chokmeta (חָכְמְתָא, 'Wisdom') sings in the streets; in the Kinnusha (בְּכִנּוּשָׁא, 'gathering') she raises her voice."

These are not archaizing affectations. The Aramaic-speaking Jewish communities that produced the Targumim and transmitted the mystical traditions behind the Zohar used כְּנִשְׁתָּא as their *natural* word for "assembly" — the same word that Neo-Babylonian scribes rendered as *kiništu* a millennium earlier. The /š/ sibilant persisted unbroken in Aramaic from the Bronze Age through Late Antiquity and into the medieval period, while Hebrew alone innovated to /s/.

### 5. Steiner: Against Uniformity Assumptions

Richard Steiner's study of spirantization in Aramaic and Hebrew (2005) provides the theoretical license for treating KNŠ and KNS as independent regional reflexes rather than borrowings in one direction or another.

Steiner's central argument:

> "Like all ancient historians, those of us who deal with the history of ancient languages are dependent on chance discoveries for the data with which we work. We are faced with enormous gaps in the historical record, and we compensate for them by making simplifying assumptions — assumptions that favor uniformity over variation."
> — Steiner, "Variation, Simplifying Assumptions, and the History of Spirantization in Aramaic and Hebrew" (2005), p. 52

> "We should never forget that each simplifying assumption that we employ increases the tenuousness of our conclusions."
> — Steiner, p. 53

Steiner demonstrates that spirantization — the shift of stops to fricatives in begadkephat consonants — did not occur at the same time or in the same way across all Semitic-speaking communities. Samaritan Hebrew, for example, never spirantized velars (k, g), while Tiberian Hebrew did. The assumption that a phonological change attested in one region can be projected uniformly onto all regions is, in Steiner's term, part of a "gentleman's agreement" — "a tacit understanding among scholars" that has never been rigorously tested.

**The implication for KNŠ/KNS**: If spirantization varied by region and period, so could sibilant shifts. Aramaic speakers preserving /š/ while Hebrew speakers shifted to /s/ need not imply borrowing — it may reflect independent retention of an older form in one community and innovation in another.

### 6. Mańczak/Bartoli: Conservative Periphery Theory

Witold Mańczak (1988) tested Matteo Bartoli's famous "second norm" of areal linguistics against quantitative Romance language data and proved it statistically valid:

> **Bartoli's Second Norm**: "If one of two linguistic stages is found in peripheral areas and the other in a central area, the stage occurring in the peripheral areas is usually the earlier one."

Mańczak's generalization eliminates the need to define "peripheral" and "central":

> "If phenomenon B occurs in one area and phenomenon A occurs in more than one area, phenomenon A usually is older than phenomenon B, and the probability that phenomenon A is an archaism is larger, the larger the number of areas where A occurs."
> — Mańczak, "Bartoli's Second 'Norm'" (1988), p. 78

**Application to KNŠ/KNS**:

| Sibilant | Attestation Areas |
|----------|-------------------|
| /š/ (KNŠ) | Egyptian transcription (KU-NU-SHA), Neo-Assyrian (*kannušu*), Neo-Babylonian (*kiništu*), Aramaic (*kenishtā*), Zoharic/Targumic (*kenishtā*, *kinnushā*) |
| /s/ (KNS) | Hebrew alone (*kānas*, *kenos*, *knesset*) |

By Mańczak's generalized criterion, the form attested in **more areas** is usually the older one. KNŠ with /š/ appears across five independent attestation contexts spanning two millennia and three language families; KNS with /s/ appears in Hebrew alone. The probability is overwhelming: **KNŠ is the archaism, KNS is the innovation.**

---

## Synthesis: Knossos as KNŠ

If the original sibilant was /š/, then the name **Knossos** (Egyptian KU-NU-SHA) preserves a Bronze Age form *\*Kənuš-* or *\*Knuš-* meaning "Gathering Place" — with the same sibilant that Aramaic maintained and Hebrew replaced.

The trajectory:
- **Bronze Age**: *\*K-N-Š* ("to gather") — attested in Egyptian transcription of Knossos
- **1st millennium BCE**: Akkadian *kiništu* (priestly assembly), *kannušu* (harvest gathering)
- **Late antiquity**: Aramaic כְּנִשְׁתָּא — synagogue, sacred assembly
- **Hebrew innovation**: כְּנֶסֶת — the same word, with /š/ shifted to /s/
- **Medieval preservation**: Zoharic כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישְׁתָּא — Holy Assembly, /š/ intact

The Zohar's "Kenishta Qadishta" is not an archaism by accident. It preserves, through unbroken Aramaic transmission, the same sibilant that Egyptian scribes heard in the name of the Minoan palace-sanctuary three thousand years earlier.

---

## The Greek Side: How /š/ Became σ and σσ

The preceding arguments establish KNŠ as the older Semitic sibilant from Egyptian transcription, Akkadian cognates, and Aramaic preservation. But the argument has a second, independent leg: **Greek phonology itself predicts the loss of /š/**. The Linear B syllabary and the pre-Greek substrate both demonstrate that an original postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/, i.e. "sh") systematically entered Greek as sigma (σ) or double sigma (σσ) — because Greek had no /ʃ/ phoneme.

### 7. Greek Has No /ʃ/: The Sibilant Collapse

The Linear B syllabary has only **one sibilant series** (s-series: sa, se, si, so, su). There is no sh-series. The separate z-series (za, ze, zo) represents palatalized affricates from Indo-European palatalization, not a sibilant distinction.

This means three distinct Semitic sibilants collapsed into a single Greek sigma:

| Semitic Phoneme | IPA | Hebrew Letter | Greek Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| shin | /ʃ/ | שׁ | σ (sigma) |
| samekh | /s/ | ס | σ (sigma) |
| tsade | /ts/ | צ | σ (sigma) |
| sin | /ɬ/ | שׂ | σ (sigma) |

Every distinction obliterated. This is not a theoretical inference — it is documented in the sibilant correspondences of confirmed Semitic loanwords in Linear B.

Martin Bernal dedicates *Black Athena* Vol. 3, Ch. 13 ("Semitic Sibilants," pp. 371–385) to precisely this mapping, with subsections on "Loans of Sibilants from Canaanite into Greek" (pp. 373ff), "Lateral Fricatives" (pp. 380ff), and "Sheltered /s/ sC /s/ Before Consonants" (pp. 383ff).

Bernal's introduction establishes the complexity:

> "It is generally recognized that Proto-Semitic had three [unvoiced, unemphatic sibilants], conventionally labeled /s¹/, /s²/ and /s³/... In Phoenician, unlike the more conservative Hebrew, *sin* merged with *shin*."
> — Bernal, *Black Athena* Vol. 3, p. 371

His key statement on the Greek absorption mechanism:

> "Greek lacked this multiplicity of unvoiced sibilants. Therefore, in loans from West Semitic or Akkadian before 1200 BCE, /s¹/-/s/, later /s³/, was rendered as /s/. For instance, *ššmn*, the conventional Ugaritic and Phoenician transcription, was written *sasama* in Linear B and σήσαμον in alphabetic Greek."
> — Bernal, *Black Athena* Vol. 3, p. 373

Bernal also notes the -σσ-/-ττ- alternation in the context of Afroasiatic sibilant loans:

> "Other Afroasiatic sibilants, however, also appear to have sounded uncertain to Greek speakers and to have appeared in many different forms including -ss-/-tt-. Probably the best-known example of the alternation is θάλασσα/θάλαττα 'sea.'"
> — Bernal, *Black Athena* Vol. 3, p. 167

R. Whitney Tucker, "A Note on the Interpretation of Mycenaean Sibilants" (*AJA* 71, 1967; doi: 10.2307/502002), analyzes the Linear B s-series and confirms its inability to distinguish sibilant qualities.

### 8. Semitic Loanwords in Linear B: š → σ Documented

The following words are attested on Linear B tablets and traced to Semitic sources where the original had shin (šin) or tsade (ṣade). In every case, the Semitic sibilant becomes Greek sigma:

| Linear B | Greek | Semitic Source | Original Sibilant | Greek Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **sa-sa-ma** | σήσαμον / σάσαμον (Doric) | Akk. **šamaššammu** "oil-seed" | **š** (shin) ×2 | σ (sigma) |
| **ku-ru-so** | χρυσός "gold" | Heb. **חָרוּץ** (*ḥārūṣ*) | **צ** (tsade) | σ (sigma) |
| **ku-pa-ri-so** | κυπάρισσος "cypress" | Heb. **כֹּפֶר/גֹּפֶר** (*kopher/gopher*) | — | σσ (double sigma) |
| **ki-to** | χιτών "tunic" | Heb. **כֻּתֹּנֶת** (*kuttōnet*) | — | (no sibilant) |
| **ku-mi-no** | κύμινον "cumin" | Sem. **kammōn** (כַּמֹּן) | — | (no sibilant) |

The **sa-sa-ma** case is decisive. Akkadian *šamaššammu* has shin (š) twice; Greek renders both as sigma (σ). Bernal confirms this directly: "*ššmn*, the conventional Ugaritic and Phoenician transcription, was written *sasama* in Linear B and σήσαμον in alphabetic Greek" (*Black Athena* Vol. 3, p. 373). The Doric form σάσαμον preserves the a-vowels closer to the Akkadian source, suggesting a very early borrowing — pre-Ionic vowel shift. Etymonline traces it "via Phoenician from Late Babylonian *šawašš-šammu*."

For **ku-ru-so** (χρυσός), Hebrew *ḥārūṣ* has tsade (צ), which Greek also maps to sigma. The pathway is the same: a non-Greek sibilant → σ.

Émilia Masson (*Recherches sur les plus anciens emprunts sémitiques en grec*, 1967) and Rafał Rosół ("Early Semitic Loanwords in Greek," 2018) catalogue approximately 50–80 confirmed Semitic loans, many involving this sibilant flattening.

### 9. The Pre-Greek -σσ-/-ττ- Alternation (Beekes)

Robert Beekes (*Pre-Greek: Phonology, Morphology, Lexicon*, Brill 2014) identifies a **single pre-Greek phoneme** — likely a palatal affricate or postalveolar sibilant — that Greek speakers heard and rendered variably as:

- **-σσ-** (Ionic/Koine dialects)
- **-ττ-** (Attic dialect)
- **-τθ-** (aspirated variant — impossible in Proto-Indo-European, confirming substrate origin)

Beekes describes this as "a single pre-Greek phoneme that received threefold representation in Greek" because the pre-Greek substrate "possessed consonant series that lacked distinctive voicing and aspiration."

Pre-Greek substrate words displaying this diagnostic pattern:

| Greek | Meaning | Alternation | Pre-Greek Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **θάλασσα / θάλαττα** | sea | σσ/ττ | Confirmed pre-Greek (Beekes) |
| **Παρνασσός / Παρναττός** | mountain name | σσ/ττ | Confirmed pre-Greek |
| **νάρκισσος** | narcissus | σσ | Confirmed pre-Greek |
| **κυπάρισσος** | cypress | σσ | Pre-Greek / Semitic loan |
| **κασσίτερος** | tin | σσ | Pre-Greek (cf. Akk. *kasitiru*) |
| **Ὀδυσσεύς / Ὀλυττεύς** | Odysseus | σσ/ττ + l/d variation | Confirmed pre-Greek |
| **Κνωσσός** | Knossos | σσ | Pre-Greek |

The -τθ- variant (aspirated double tau) cannot arise from any Indo-European phonological process. Its existence is proof that the underlying phoneme was foreign to Greek — exactly what a Semitic /š/ would produce in speakers who had no category for it.

Beekes further notes that pre-Greek lacked distinctive voicing and aspiration, which explains why substrate words show free variation between plain, voiced, and aspirated stops (e.g. Odysseus ~ Ulixes, with d/l variation). This is consistent with Semitic phonology, where emphatic consonants and sibilant categories do not align with the Greek three-way stop distinction.

### 10. The Convergence: Κνωσσός as the Predicted Outcome

All lines converge on a single prediction:

1. **Semitic KNŠ** has shin (שׁ = /ʃ/)
2. **Egyptian scribes** transcribe Knossos with *sh* (= Semitic "true" shin) — confirming the /š/ (Astour 1966)
3. **Greek has no /ʃ/ phoneme** — Linear B's s-series cannot distinguish /s/ from /ʃ/
4. **Semitic loanwords** in Linear B show š → σ systematically (sa-sa-ma, ku-ru-so)
5. **Pre-Greek substrate words** with the "foreign sibilant" display -σσ-/-ττ- alternation (Beekes)
6. **Κνωσσός has double -σσ-** — the exact diagnostic marker Beekes identifies for pre-Greek words with this phoneme

The double sigma in Κνωσσός is not a random orthographic convention. It is the **predicted Greek reflex of a Semitic /š/** — the same phoneme that Aramaic preserves as shin in כְּנִשְׁתָּא and that Hebrew later flattened to samekh in כְּנֶסֶת.

The Semitic side (§§1–6) and the Greek side (§§7–10) arrive at the same conclusion independently: **the original sibilant in the name of Knossos was /š/, not /s/**.

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Egyptian topographic list of Amenhotep III** (c. 1390–1352 BCE):
Entry 7: *Ku-nu-sha* = Knossos. Egyptian *sh* = Semitic "true" shin.

**Deuteronomy 32:34** (Hebrew Bible):
> הֲלֹא־הוּא **כָּמֻס** עִמָּדִי חָתֻם בְּאוֹצְרֹתָי
> "Is not this **stored** (*kāmūs*) with me, sealed in my storehouses?"

The unique Biblical attestation of KMS — the earliest stratum of the root, cognate with Akkadian *kamāsu*.

**Akkadian** (*The Poor Man of Nippur*):
> *ikmis ana quppima // iktanak kišippiš*
> "He gathered them into a cage, sealed it with a seal."

*kamāsu* in parallelism with *kanāku* ("to seal") — the same semantic pairing as Hebrew KMS // ḤTM in Deut 32:34.

**Neo-Babylonian administrative texts**:
*kiništu* (and by-forms *kinaštu*, *kinaltu*, *kinartu*) — priestly assembly class.

**Zohar II, 135a**:
> כְּנִשְׁתָּא קַדִּישָׁא... כְּנִשְׁתָּא דִּשְׁכִינָה
> "Kenishta Qadisha... Kenishta of the Shekhinah"

**Targum Proverbs 1:20**:
> חָכְמְתָא... בְּכִנּוּשָׁא
> "Chokmeta... in the Kinnusha (gathering)"

### Scholarly Support

**Paul, Shalom** (1996): Established the KMS/KNS/KNŠ cognate relationship. Documented Akkadian *kamāsu*, *kannušu*, and *kiništu*. Argued for m/n interchange as the mechanism linking KMS to KNS.

**Astour, Michael C.** (1966): Identified Egyptian KU-NU-SHA as Knossos. Established that Egyptian *sh* = Semitic "true" shin.

**Steiner, Richard C.** (2005): Challenged uniformity assumptions in dating phonological changes across Aramaic and Hebrew. Demonstrated regional variation in spirantization.

**Mańczak, Witold** (1988): Statistically validated Bartoli's second norm. Proved that forms attested in more areas are usually older.
