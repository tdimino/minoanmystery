# Asherah and the Snake Goddess of Knossos

## Overview

Arthur Evans's famous "Snake Goddess" figurines from Knossos have long been interpreted as distinctively Minoan. However, recent scholarship reveals that this iconic image is **a hybrid of Levantine and Cretan iconographies**. Tracey Cian (2015) documents that Asherah was called "Lady of the Serpent" in Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, and that the Levantine snake cult—associated with the mother goddess—flourished from the Bronze through Iron Ages. The Minoan Snake Goddess does not represent a purely Aegean phenomenon but participates in a trans-Mediterranean goddess tradition connecting Mesopotamia, the Levant, and Crete.

This connection strengthens the thesis of Part II: that Knossos was a center of the divine feminine with deep Near Eastern roots. The same goddess who was Athirat at Ugarit, Asherah in Canaan, and "Lady of the Serpent" in Sinai manifested at Knossos as the Snake Goddess—different names for a shared religious reality spanning the Bronze Age Mediterranean.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Evans's Snake Goddess: Hybrid Iconography

**Cian's analysis** (2015):
> "The statue was taken apart and reassembled by Bonney, who proved this image did not represent what Evans had called 'Neopalatial elite women' but, instead, it was **a hybrid of Levantine and Cretan iconographies**, which only provided more speculation on her origin."

**What Bonney demonstrated**:
- The figurines are not purely Minoan in origin
- They incorporate Levantine iconographic elements
- The snake-goddess tradition spans cultural boundaries

**Implication**: The Knossos Snake Goddess cannot be understood in isolation from Near Eastern goddess traditions. She is a local manifestation of a widespread Mediterranean phenomenon.

### 2. Asherah as "Lady of the Serpent"

**Cian on Asherah's serpent associations** (2015, citing Ackerman 2003):
> "There is also a tentative identification of the snake god in this period; it seems like its identity was probably female and this is supported by the presence of nipples and lacteal droplets or the representation of snakes behind a female figurine—this is also reinforced by the image of the goddess Asherah who Ackerman describes as 'the mother goddess of Canaanite religion, called both the "mother" and the "creatress" of the gods at Ugarit. [...] Numerous Egyptian representations from the New Kingdom depict the goddess nude, viewed frontally, standing astride a lion and holding snakes in either one or both hands.'"

**Proto-Sinaitic evidence**: The inscription **Sinai 349** from Serabit el-Khadim features serpent imagery alongside Ba'alat ("Lady") iconography. While no inscription directly reads "Lady of the Serpent," the consistent association of serpent symbols with the mother goddess in the Proto-Sinaitic corpus supports the connection. Albright noted Asherah's identification with a serpent goddess tradition in this context.

**The evidence chain**:
- Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions: Serpent imagery associated with Ba'alat
- Egyptian New Kingdom depictions: Goddess holding snakes
- Ugaritic texts: Athirat as mother/creatress of gods
- Minoan Crete: Snake Goddess figurines

### 3. Levantine Snake Cult: Bronze Age Florescence

**Cian on Levantine snake worship**:
> "With regards to representation of snakes, the majority of objects that present snake symbols have been found both in cultic and domestic contexts in Canaan from the Bronze to the Iron Age."

**Middle Bronze Age development**:
> "From the Middle Bronze Age, the snake motifs 'suggest the significance of their functions as cultic objects [because] the independent snake figurines, pottery or metal (copper/bronze), probably were idols' and they were used for libation purposes or placed in places where other gods (e.g. Baal or Asherah) were worshipped."

**Late Bronze Age standardization**:
> "The Late Bronze Age presents 'clear evidence of iconographic standardisation of the snake motifs which suggests that **the snake cult was gaining momentum to become institutionalised**.'"

The snake cult reached its peak during the same period (Late Bronze Age) when Minoan-Levantine contacts were most intense.

### 4. Female Identification of the Snake Deity

**Cian's evidence for female snake deity**:
> "There is also a tentative identification of the snake god in this period; it seems like its identity was **probably female** and this is supported by the presence of nipples and lacteal droplets or the representation of snakes behind a female figurine."

**The iconographic evidence**:
- Nipples and lacteal droplets on figurines
- Snakes positioned behind female figures
- Association with nursing/motherhood imagery

This matches the Minoan Snake Goddess, who is emphatically female, bare-breasted, and associated with fertility/nursing symbolism.

### 5. Iron Age Decline: The Coming of Yahwism

**Cian on religious transformation**:
> "In the Levantine Iron Age, archaeological material record relating to snakes **decreases significantly**, though they still continued to exist in cultic settings. This was probably due to **the coming of the cult of Yahweh** in the territories of Israel and Judah during Iron I and II."

**The implication**: The snake-goddess tradition was suppressed as Yahwism consolidated. This parallels the later polemic against Asherah/asherim in biblical texts. The Bronze Age goddess tradition did not disappear—it went underground or was absorbed into Yahwism (see [canaanite-baalim-yahweh-absorption.md](../part-3-minos/canaanite-baalim-yahweh-absorption.md)).

### 6. Snake Cult Objects: The Archaeological Record

**Types of snake-related objects** (Cian):
> "These objects include: Appliqués on stone or pottery vessels, Clay plaques, Cylindrical stands, Shrine models with snake reliefs/emblems (also named 'snake boxes'), Statuettes, Pendants, Pottery, bronze and iron snake figurines, A bronze standard, Snake markings on a statuette, on pottery vessels or on a silver cup, Rock engravings, and Snake altars."

**Cultic and domestic contexts**: Snake imagery appeared in both temple and household settings, suggesting both official and popular religion incorporated serpent symbolism.

### 7. The Mesopotamian Background

**Cian on Mesopotamian snake traditions**:
> "In Mesopotamian religious art, it is possible to establish that certain symbols were used as surrogates to the deities themselves—not only could one god have more than one symbol but also one symbol could represent more gods."

**Underworld associations**:
> "The 'reptilian iconography originated from its associations with the underworld and with an underworld god.'"

> "Snakes also represented the god Ninghišzida, who... was worshipped in Lagaš. Being revered in Lagaš, he also became the personal god of the ruler of the city, Gudea, who is occasionally depicted with the god with horned snakes rising up from his shoulders."

**Apotropaic function**:
> "From this brief overview, it is plausible to assume that, in Mesopotamian culture, snakes were associated to deities from the underworld, which occasionally took on an **apotropaic function**—i.e. a protective function, and this belief spanned across several millennia."

### 8. The Omphalos as Python's Tomb

**Harrison on the snake-mound at Delphi** (*Themis*, 1912, p. 389):

> "Varro provides a crucial tradition: the omphalos at Delphi is the tumulus of Python, a sacred snake. The omphalos is thus a grave-mound marked by a holy stone, combining elements of tomb and tombstone."

The omphalos—literally "navel"—was understood as both cosmic center and serpent burial. This conflation of world-axis and snake-grave recurs across the Mediterranean:

| Site | Serpent Association | Function |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| **Delphi** | Python's tomb beneath omphalos | Oracle, earth-navel |
| **Knossos** | Snake-tubes, snake-goddess | Palace cult center |
| **Jerusalem** | *Even HaShetiyyah* ("Foundation Stone") | Temple center, abyss |

The pattern suggests **sacred geography organized around serpent-graves**: the snake that guards the threshold between worlds, whose burial sanctifies the site. The Minoan Snake Goddess may preside over analogous sacred topography.

### 9. Snake-Tribes and Totemism: Kadmos and the Spartoi

**Harrison on the "Tribe of the Serpent"** (*Themis*, 1912, p. 434):

> "We know now what lies behind these metamorphoses. A man is turned into what he really was. Kadmos is turned into a snake because he was a Snake-man, the snake-man, head and king of a Snake-group. The snake was the blazon of the Spartoi."

The **Spartoi** ("Sown Men") who sprang from the dragon's teeth Kadmos planted at Thebes were a **serpent-tribe**—their totemic identity encoded in mythology. Harrison's insight: transformation into a snake at death *reveals* the hero's true identity.

**Pindar's Dithyramb 75** (quoted in Harrison, *Themis*, p. 203):

> "I come to dance and sing, the child of a father most high and **a woman of Cadmus' race**."

Bromios (Dionysos) claims descent through Semele, daughter of Kadmos—making the god himself of the Serpent lineage.

### 10. Trans-Mediterranean Goddess Tradition

**The synthesis**:

| Tradition | Name | Snake Association |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| Mesopotamian | Ninghišzida, Mušhuššu | Underworld, protection |
| Levantine | Asherah | "Lady of the Serpent" |
| Canaanite | Athirat | Mother goddess, snake-handler |
| Minoan | Snake Goddess | Faience figurines, cult |
| Greek | Athena | Shield with snake, aegis |

**The pattern**: A mother/protection goddess associated with serpents spans the entire Bronze Age Mediterranean. The Minoan Snake Goddess is not an isolated phenomenon but part of this trans-regional tradition.

### 9. Connection to Potnia and the Bee Goddess

**Linkage to existing Knossos dossiers**:

The Snake Goddess connects to the Potnia/Deborah tradition (see [potnia-daboritu-baalat-deborah.md](./potnia-daboritu-baalat-deborah.md)):
- Both represent the divine feminine at Knossos
- Both have Levantine parallels (Asherah/Ba'alat Deborah)
- Both involve priestess impersonation of the goddess

**Marinatos on goddess embodiment**:
> "By far the most important aspect of female priesthood was the impersonation of the goddess."

The priestesses who held snakes at Knossos may have been embodying the "Lady of the Serpent"—the same goddess known as Asherah in the Levant.
