# Knossos as Knossot: The Gathering Place

## Overview

The name **Knossos** (Κνωσός) may preserve a Semitic root *k-n-s* meaning "to gather, assemble." This etymology—proposed by scholars examining Aegean-Semitic linguistic connections—would make Knossos the "Gathering Place" or "Assembly," a name befitting the Minoan palace's function as a ceremonial and administrative center where priestesses, officials, and worshippers convened for religious rites and economic distribution.

The Hebrew Bible attests the root *k-n-s* exclusively in verbal forms, yet later Aramaic and Mishnaic Hebrew develop the noun **כְּנֶסֶת** (*knesset*, "assembly")—the term that gives modern Israel's parliament its name. The phonological match is precise: the construct form **כְּנוֹס** (*kenos*, infinitive construct in Ecclesiastes 3:5) produces the consonant cluster *Kn-* that maps directly to Greek *Κν-* in Κνωσός. The sheva (ְ) under the כ represents an ultra-short or effectively silent vowel, yielding the same initial cluster.

This dossier traces the Knossos etymology through biblical attestations, Semitic assembly terminology, and the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos—where excavation reports note "the comingling of Minoan remains and Hellenistic deposits," suggesting cult continuity across two millennia.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The K-N-S Root in Biblical Hebrew

**Biblical attestations** (verb forms only):

| Passage | Hebrew | Translation |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Esther 4:16** | לֵךְ **כְּנוֹס** אֶת־כָּל־הַיְּהוּדִים | "Go, **assemble** all the Jews" |
| **Psalm 33:7** | **כֹּנֵס** כַּנֵּד מֵי הַיָּם | "[God] **heaps up** the ocean waters" |
| **Nehemiah 12:44** | **לִכְנוֹס** בָּהֶם...מְנָאוֹת | "to **gather** into them... the **portions**" |
| **Ecclesiastes 3:5** | עֵת **כְּנוֹס** אֲבָנִים | "a time to **gather** stones" |

**Phonological analysis**: In Ecclesiastes 3:5, the infinitive construct **כְּנוֹס** (*kenos*) shows the consonant cluster *kn-* without intervening vowel. The sheva (ְ) under the kaph is an ultra-short vowel that effectively produces the cluster **Kn-**, which maps directly to Greek **Κν-** in Κνωσός.

### 2. Nehemiah 12:44 — K-N-S + M-N-H Together

**The verse**:
> לִכְנוֹס בָּהֶם לִשְׂדֵי הֶעָרִים **מְנָאוֹת** הַתּוֹרָה לַכֹּהֲנִים וְלַלְוִיִּם
> "to **gather** (*liknos*) into them from the fields of the towns the **portions** (*menaot*) prescribed by the Teaching for the priests and Levites"

**Significance**: This verse pairs K-N-S (gathering/assembly) with M-N-H (portions/allotment)—the same semantic pairing underlying the proposed Knossos-Minos compound. The palace at Knossos functioned precisely as a gathering place where portions were distributed: temple storerooms received agricultural tribute, which was then allotted to personnel serving the sanctuary.

### 3. Later Development: Knesset

**Mishnaic attestation** (Pirkei Abot 1:1):
> וּנְבִיאִים מְסָרוּהָ לְאַנְשֵׁי **כְנֶסֶת** הַגְּדוֹלָה
> "and the prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great **Assembly** (*Knesset HaGedolah*)"

**The noun form**: While biblical Hebrew uses only verbal forms, post-biblical texts develop the noun כְּנֶסֶת (*knesset*), "assembly." This demonstrates the root's semantic core: gathering for communal purpose—whether religious, political, or judicial.

**Rabbinic parallels**:
- **בֵּית כְּנֶסֶת** (*bet knesset*) = synagogue ("house of assembly")
- **Minyan** (quorum of ten) = minimum assembly for communal prayer
- **Shekhinah dwells** wherever there is assembly (Talmudic principle)

### 4. Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos

**Archaeological evidence**:
On Gypsadhes hill, just south of the Minoan palace complex, excavators uncovered a Sanctuary of Demeter dating to 550–330 BCE.

**Coldstream's observation** (1973): "Excavation reports note the comingling of Minoan remains and Hellenistic deposits"—suggesting cult continuity at the site.

**Demeter's Cretan associations**:
- Cave cult: "Few, if any, caves on the mainland can be shown to have witnessed cult in Mycenaean times... The traditions connected with chthonic cave cult did, however, tenaciously survive into historic times and generally in the cult of Demeter."
- Peak sanctuaries: "Peak sites continued to be frequented on Crete until historic times."

### 5. Homeric Hymn to Apollo: "Wooded Cnossus"

**Homeric Hymn to Apollo** (lines 393–396):
Apollo addresses Cretan sailors whom he brings to Delphi as his priests:
> "Strangers, who dwelt aforetime round **wooded Cnossus**..."

**Significance**: The epithet "wooded" (ὑλήεντα) suggests Knossos's sanctuary character—a sacred grove or forest setting. This matches Demeter's chthonic associations and the pattern of tree-sanctuaries throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.

### 6. Kenishta di Qadusha

**Aramaic terminology**:
- **כְּנִישְׁתָּא דִּי קַדּוּשָׁא** (*Kenishta di Qadusha*) = "Kenishta of Qadusha"
- Used in Targumic and later Aramaic texts for sacred gatherings

**Zoharic attestations**:

> **Zohar I, 33b:** "Rabbi Yehuda said: When the Qadosh Barukh Hu (קָדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, 'Holy One, Blessed be He') wishes to enter the Kenishta (כְּנִישְׁתָּא, 'gathering'), He first looks at the Kenishta, and only then does He enter."

> **Zohar II, 135a:** "And they are called the Kenishta Qadisha (כְּנִישְׁתָּא קַדִּישָׁא, 'holy gathering'), the Kenishta of the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה). When they join together, they are called the Kenishta of Qedusha (קְדוּשָׁה, 'holiness')."

#### 6a. Kinnusha in Proverbs

**Targum Proverbs 1:20**:
> "Chokmeta (חָכְמְתָא, 'Wisdom') sings in the streets; in the Kinnusha (בְּכִנּוּשָׁא, 'gathering') she raises her voice."

#### 6b. Shekhinah Dwells Where There Is Kenishta

**Zohar III, 19a**:
> "Therefore, wherever a Kenishta (כְּנִישְׁתָּא, 'gathering') is found, the Shekhinah (שְׁכִינָה) dwells. For this reason, a person should join the Kenishta, so that he may be found with the Shekhinah."

**Proverbs and oral tradition**: The term **Kinnusha** appears in wisdom literature contexts. Proverbs, like the Zohar, participate in an oral tradition stretching to remote antiquity. The ultimate age of a single saying could conceivably go back to the dawn of human speech—preserving vocabulary that predates written attestations.

#### 6c. Allen on Ceremonial Gathering

The ceremony-as-integration model from Paula Gunn Allen illuminates the *knesset* function of Knossos—what the sacred gathering accomplished:

> "The purpose of a ceremony is to integrate: to fuse the individual with his or her fellows, the community of people with that of the other kingdoms, and this larger communal group with the worlds beyond this one." (Allen, *Sacred Hoop*, p. 91)

> "This community is not made up only of members of the tribe but necessarily includes all beings that inhabit the tribe's universe." (Allen, *Sacred Hoop*, p. 91–92)

This is precisely what the Zoharic concept of *Kenishta Qadisha* describes: gathering that enables divine indwelling. The Minoan palace-sanctuary served this integrative function—fusing individual worshippers, the human community, the natural world, and the divine realms.

### 7. Palace as Gathering-Distribution Center

**Minoan palatial function**:
The Knossos palace was not primarily a royal residence but a ceremonial-administrative complex:

| Function | Archaeological Evidence | Marinatos (1993) |
|----------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Storage** | Massive *pithoi* (storage jars) in west magazines | — |
| **Distribution** | Linear B tablets recording rations, allocations | — |
| **Assembly** | Central court for gatherings, theatrical area | — |
| **Cult** | Shrine rooms, lustral basins, pillar crypts | — |
| **Priest-Administration** | Linear A tablets with priest ideograms | "sacerdotal figures... close contacts with economy" |
| **Professional Priesthood** | Linear B *hiereus* designation | "the designation *hiereus* points to a profession" |

**Marinatos on Linear A priestly records** (ch. 6):
> "On certain Linear A tablets from Hagia Triada, there appear ideograms of priests with long robes and axes on their shoulders alongside the syllabic signs. The contents of the inscriptions are undeciphered, but it is almost certain that commodities were catalogued and listed on the tablets. The presence of the sacerdotal figures is one more piece of evidence for the close contacts of the sacerdotal class with economy."

This priest-administration nexus confirms the *knesset* model: the Gathering Place was where priestly officials managed both religious rites and economic distribution.

**The semantic fit**: If Knossos means "Gathering Place," the name describes the palace's essential function—a *knesset* where the community assembled for ritual and economic exchange.

#### 7a. Scully: The Four Complementary Enclosures

Vincent Scully's analysis of Greek sacred architecture confirms the temple-sanctuary interpretation of Knossos. The "palace" was not a royal residence but a liturgical space structured around processional movement toward the divine:

> "Within that space the constructed elements take their form and create four complementary types of enclosures. They are: the labyrinthine passage, the open court, the columned pavilion, and the pillared cave. ... The natural and the man-made create one ritual whole."
> — Scully, *The Earth, The Temple, and The Gods*, p. 11

All four enclosure types appear at every Minoan "palace"—Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, Zakros:
- **Labyrinthine passage**: The winding corridors throughout the complex
- **Open court**: The central court where gatherings (*knesset*) occurred
- **Columned pavilion**: The *megaron* halls with their characteristic columns
- **Pillared cave**: The pillar crypts and lustral basins descending into darkness

The consistency of these four elements across all major Minoan sites suggests not royal palaces with coincidentally similar floor plans, but temples following a liturgical program.

#### 7b. Scully: Processional Movement to the Goddess Shrine

> "The processional movement from light to dark to light and dark again—culminating as it does in the innermost cavern shrine where were found at once the hollow earth of the Goddess and the pillar which both enters and supports the earth and is thus also hers."
> — Scully, *The Earth, The Temple, and The Gods*

### 8. Cretan Women and Linear A Tablets: Continuity of Reverence

**Evans's observation**:
> "Evans observed Cretan women wearing Linear tablets as charms when he was excavating in Crete, and it is more than likely that many inscriptions had been found during the Classical period."
> — Gordon, "Cadmus and the Palm-Leaf Tablets"

**Significance**: This striking detail reveals that modern Cretan women continued to revere objects from the Minoan past, wearing Linear A tablets as protective amulets millennia after the script's meaning had been lost. The tablets' sacred status persisted even when their content could no longer be read—suggesting an unbroken tradition of veneration for these artifacts from the "Gathering Place."

**Implications**: If Minoan inscriptions were discovered during the Classical period (as Gordon suggests is likely), Greek authors may have had more contact with Linear A tablets than previously assumed. The persistence of tablet-veneration among Cretan women indicates a folk memory connecting these objects to sacred power—precisely what one would expect if the tablets originated at a sanctuary-palace complex where portions were ritually distributed.

### 9. Tyrannion/Tyrannos and the Etymology of "Tyrant"

**The bishop from Tyre**:
Tyrannion of Antioch (bishop, d. c. 308 CE) appears in Eusebius's *Church History* (VII.32.4) as **Tyrannos** (Τύραννος). His name explicitly derived from his origin in the city of **Tyre** (צֹר, *Ṣor*).

**Etymology of "tyrant"**: This attestation supports the proposal that Greek **τύραννος** (*tyrannos*, "tyrant, absolute ruler") itself derives from the Phoenician city of Tyre. A *Tyrannos* was originally "one from Tyre"—a Phoenician. The association of Phoenician merchants and colonizers with power and authority would have generalized the term to mean any powerful ruler.

**From prestige to pejorative**: The semantic shift from "Tyrian" to "despot" may reflect the Athenian malignment of Minoan-Phoenician heritage. Europa herself—mother of Minos—came from Tyre. As Minoan civilization was recast in negative terms (the Minotaur, the labyrinth as prison, Minos as cruel overlord), the Tyrian/Phoenician connection to Cretan power would have acquired increasingly negative connotations. The "tyrant" thus preserves linguistic memory of Phoenician authority in the Aegean, transformed by later Greek political discourse into a term of opprobrium.
