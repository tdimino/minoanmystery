# Mystery as Pollution: Harrison's Etymology

## Overview

Jane Ellen Harrison (*Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion*, 1903/1908) proposes a radical reinterpretation of the Greek word "mystery" (μυστήριον). Against the standard derivation from μύω ("I close"—referring to closed eyes or lips, i.e., secrecy), Harrison argues that **mystery derives from μύσος (pollution)**. A mystery is not a secret to be kept but a pollution to be purified—"the doing of what relates to a μύσος."

This etymology transforms our understanding of initiation rites. The mystic does not receive hidden knowledge; rather, they undergo purification to safely handle sacred objects (*sacra*) and partake of first-fruits. The Eleusinian formula was not *Credo* (belief) but *Confiteor* (ritual acts performed): "I fasted, I drank the kykeon, I took from the chest."

When combined with Diodorus's testimony that **Cretan mysteries were open to all** (unlike secretive Eleusis), Harrison's etymology suggests that the original Minoan pattern was public purification ritual, not esoteric knowledge transmission.

## Key Arguments

### 1. The Standard Etymology and Its Problems

**Harrison** (*Prolegomena*, p. 154):
> "The derivation of mystery from μύω, though possible, is not satisfactory."

The conventional view: μυστήριον derives from μύω ("I close"), referring to the closed eyes/lips of initiates sworn to secrecy. But Harrison notes:

> "The ancients themselves were not quite comfortable about the connection with μύω. They knew and felt that mystery, secrecy, was not the main gist of 'a mystery': **the essence of it all primarily was purification** in order that you might safely eat and handle certain sacra."

### 2. Mystery = The Doing of What Relates to Pollution

**Harrison** (*Prolegomena*, p. 154):
> "Merely as an insulting conjecture Clement in his irresponsible abusive fashion throws out what I believe to be the real origin of the word mystery. 'I think,' he says, 'that these orgies and mysteries of yours ought to be derived, the one from the wrath (ὀργή) of Demeter against Zeus, the other from **the pollution (μύσος) relating to Dionysos**.' Of course Clement is formally quite incorrect, but he hits on what seems a possible origin of the word mystery, that **it is the doing of what relates to a μύσος, a pollution, it is primarily a ceremony of purification**."

**Lydus** (*De Mensibus* IV.38):
> "Mysteries are from the separating away of a pollution (μύσος) as equivalent to sanctification."

### 3. No Revelation, Only Taboo Overcome

**Harrison** (*Prolegomena*, p. 154):
> "There was no revelation, no secret to be kept, only **a mysterious taboo to be prepared for and finally overcome**. It might be a taboo on eating first-fruits, it might be a taboo on handling magical sacra. In the Thesmophoria, the women fast before they touch the sacra; in the Eleusinian mysteries you sacrifice a pig before you offer and partake of the first-fruits. **The gist of it all is purification.**"

### 4. Ritual Acts, Not Dogma

**Harrison** (*Prolegomena*, p. 160):
> "It is significant of the whole attitude of Greek religion that **the confession is not a confession of dogma or even faith, but an avowal of ritual acts performed**. This is the measure of the gulf between ancient and modern. The Greeks in their greater wisdom saw that uniformity in ritual was desirable and possible; they left a man practically free in the only sphere where freedom is of real importance, i.e. in the matter of thought."

The Eleusinian *synthema* (token/password):
> "I fasted, I drank the kykeon, I took from the chest, (having tasted?) I put back into the basket and from the basket into the chest."

### 5. *Do ut abeas* vs. *Do ut des*

**Harrison** (*Prolegomena*, p. 161):
> "When the nature of that ritual was examined, it was seen to consist not in sacrifice like that paid to the Olympians, which was of the nature of tendance and might be embodied in the formula **do ut des** ['I give that you may give'], but rather of **ceremonies of aversion based on ignorance and fear**. Its formula was **do ut abeas** ['I give that you may go away']."

The chthonic/mystery tradition operates on a fundamentally different logic than Olympian religion:
- **Olympian**: Transactional gift-exchange with gods
- **Chthonic/Mystery**: Purification and riddance of pollution

### 6. Cretan Mysteries Were Open

**Diodorus of Sicily** (via Harrison, *Themis* ch. 3):
> "At Knossos the custom was the rites should be open to all. Things that among others were communicated in secrecy, the Cretans concealed from no one who wished to know."

**Implication**: If mystery originally meant "purification from pollution" rather than "secret knowledge," then the Cretan pattern of **open mysteries** makes perfect sense. There was nothing to hide—only a ritual process to undergo.

### 7. Initiation as Completion, Not Entry

**Harrison** (*Epilegomena*, 1921):
> "The Greek word for *initiation* (τελετή) tells its own tale, it means not entering in, but **completion, accomplishment, fulfilment**, its cognate (τέλειος) means 'grown up.'"

Harrison notes that "marriage and death have universally been held by mankind to be 'fulfilments' (τέλη)"—the same root. The initiate does not *enter* a secret society; they *complete* a process of purification that enables safe contact with the sacred.

## Evidence

### Primary Sources

**Clement of Alexandria** (*Protrepticus* I):
- Etymology of mysteries from μύσος (pollution)
- "The tokens of this initiation are: I ate from the timbrel, I drank from the cymbal, I carried the kernos, I passed beneath the pastos"

**Lydus** (*De Mensibus* IV.38):
- "Mysteries are from the separating away of a pollution (μύσος) as equivalent to sanctification"

**Diodorus of Sicily** (V.77):
- Cretan mysteries were open to all, not secretive

**Eleusinian synthema** (via Clement):
- "I fasted, I drank the kykeon, I took from the chest..."

### Scholarly Support

**Harrison, Jane Ellen** (*Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion*, 1903/1908): Core argument for μύσος etymology; purification as essence of mystery; *do ut abeas* formula.

**Harrison, Jane Ellen** (*Themis*, 1912): Cretan open mysteries (via Diodorus); Kouretes initiation.

**Harrison, Jane Ellen** (*Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religion*, 1921): τελετή as completion/fulfilment; initiation as maturity rite.

## Connections to Minoan Religion

Harrison's analysis, combined with Diodorus's testimony on Cretan open rites, suggests several points of contact with Minoan religious patterns documented elsewhere in this corpus:

1. **Labyrinth function**: Harrison's framework reframes the labyrinth question—if mysteries were purification complexes rather than secret repositories, the Linear B *da-pu₂-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja* ("Mistress of the Labyrinth") presided over ritual cleansing, not hidden knowledge.

2. **Chthonic goddess traditions**: Harrison associates the *do ut abeas* formula with chthonic/earth-based worship. The Minoan Snake Goddess figurines, with their associations to the underworld and renewal, align with this purificatory tradition.

3. **Cretan precedent for Greek mysteries**: Diodorus explicitly contrasts open Cretan rites with secretive Eleusinian practices. Harrison's etymology explains *why* Cretan rites could be open—there was no secret doctrine, only ritual process.

4. **Kouretes initiation pattern**: The Kouretes' role in initiating youths (documented in the Palaikastro Hymn and discussed by Harrison in *Themis*) fits the τελετή model: completion of maturity through ritual, not entry into esoteric knowledge.
