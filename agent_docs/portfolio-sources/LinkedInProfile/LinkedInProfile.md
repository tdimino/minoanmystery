# Summary

Are you at the intersection of A.I. , cognitive architecture , and gamification ?

Do you detest snake oil salesmen, stale copy, and staged demos? Then I am your guy.

I programmatically-instruct LLMs in TypeScript to accomplish tasks (and subconsciously ponder) within 'cognitive flows' that are:

Easy for users and developers to follow, and adaptable in-production Designed to be deconstructed, and (largely) LLM-agnostic More reliable, steerable, and measurable than "prompt engineering"

With the open-source repos to prove it, I can imbue a "soul" into any A.I. product or paradigm you're building, audit what you're running in-production, and increase your user retention quickly and dramatically, all by applying my own "daimonic" cognitive framework. Along the way, I develop evaluation and synthetic data pipelines for iteratively fine-tuning LoRAs and base LLMs, and believe in the idea of "ethical A.I."

Ready to rethink what A.I. means at the zenith of the Information Age? Reach out and let's talk about it!

If Walt Whitman "contained multitudes," then I am as 'crossfunctional' as they come. Born a writer and voracious reader of science-fiction novels, I transitioned into tech at an early age, christened on message boards, MMORPGs, and historic turn-based games.

️=====================================================️

After rebranding a cloud-based SaaS and LMS for higher-ed, I sharpened into a copywriter with SEO acumen, and led the content strategy for enterprise-grade clients like Dolby Labs, and the American College of Surgeons.

In the last 3 years alone, I've co-led products at Google, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, designing and launching learning curricula geared toward ML scientists, full-stack A.I. developers, and opensource in general. Recently, I steered the product design and 'agentic' flow behind an A.I. "meeting assistant" for wealth advisors at the largest bank in the world.

As a life-long language lover, and die-hard nerd at heart, I verse myself in the many uses and limitations of LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and China, and brainstorm with the brightest minds behind truly A.I. today.

When I'm not consulting for A.I./ML startups through my LLC, or delving deeper into TypeScript, and LLM-assisted programming, you'll find me hiking with my partner through upstate New York, performing live poetry, and imbuing the digital with .
