Once we had solidified a design direction for ACS, I developed a new taxonomy which enhanced navigation and search functionality within the site.

Solution: Build engines inside the runtime container itself. 2. **MPI Worker Spawn Failures**: OpenMPI's process spawning failed in Docker containers. Solution: Configured orchestrator mode to use single-process architecture. 3. **GPU Isolation**: Standard CUDA environment variables were ignored in NVIDIA container runtime. Solution: Used proper Docker Compose device reservations. 4. **LoRA Cache OOM**: Default LoRA cache size insufficient for 70B models. Solution: Configured host memory and max adapter size parameters. 5. **RoPE Configuration**: Extended context models use custom RoPE scaling. Solution: Verified automatic reading of scaling parameters from config files. 6. **BF16 LoRA Dtype Mismatch**: Host NumPy doesn't support BF16. Solution: Store BF16 bit-patterns in uint16 arrays, converting via FP32 intermediate. 7. **Weight Streaming**: Plugin weights aren't streamable. Solution: Rebuild engines with plugin disabled alongside streaming flags. 8. **Multi-GB LoRA Payloads**: gRPC/MPI transport constraints blocked large adapter uploads. Solution: Implemented system shared memory for LoRA seeding—register regions, send only metadata over gRPC. ---",

Kitchen had already tentatively identified Knossos and Amnisos; Astour confirms these and extends the identifications to cover all nine names, placing them in Crete, the Peloponnese (Kingdom of Pylos), and Kythera. The article demonstrates that Egyptians of the 14th century BCE knew specific Aegean localities far better than previously supposed, confirming steady connections between Egypt, the Levant, and the Aegean. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This provides direct documentary evidence—from an Egyptian royal inscription—of Bronze Age Egyptian knowledge of specific Minoan and Mycenaean localities, corroborating the archaeological evidence for sustained Aegean-Near Eastern contact. ---",

The article demonstrates these methods through two extended case studies: Membliaros/Poikiles as West Semitic cosmogonic terminology, and Cadmos as the West Semitic dawn-deity *qadm* whose entire mythological cycle betrays Semitic origins (Semele = *Ṣml*, Actaeon = *Aqht*, Thebes = *têbâ*, Bakchos = *bākâ*). **Why this matters for Kothar**: This article provides the essential methodological framework for all of Astour's etymological work.

He then analyzes the Greek mythological figure Danaos alongside the Ugaritic hero Danel (*Dnil*) to show functional parallels that point to a common Semitic origin. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the foundational argument that Greek civilization's mythological ancestry (the Danaans/Danaoi of Homer) traces back to Semitic populations in the Eastern Mediterranean—a key pillar of the Hellenosemitic thesis. ---",

The chapter culminates in detailed analyses of Semele (= Ugaritic *Ṣml*, \"Eagle-Mother\"), Actaeon (= Ugaritic *Aqht*), and the Semitic elements pervading the cult of Dionysos. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the core evidence that Greek mythology's most famous Phoenician—Cadmos—actually was Phoenician, with name, myths, and cult elements traceable to Ugarit and broader West Semitic religion. ---",

Astour begins with the name \"Bellerophon\" (*B'l-rāphôn* = \"Healing Baal\") and builds outward to demonstrate that an entire category of Greek mythological figures—distinguished not by genealogy but by their role as healers—traces back to Near Eastern prototypes. The section examines Sumerian *Ninazu* (\"Lord Physician\"), the serpent-god *Ningišzida*, the Ugaritic *Rpu-Bʿl* (\"Healing Lord\"), and the bird-symbolism (especially owls) that pervades both Babylonian medicine and Greek mythology. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This section reveals that Greek healing mythology is deeply rooted in Semitic and Sumerian traditions, with the serpent (a key Minoan symbol) and the owl serving as cross-cultural symbols of healing and chthonic wisdom. ---",

Astour demonstrates that Bellerophon's grandfather Sisyphos, grandmother Merope, and father Glaucos all bear names with Semitic healing-god connections. The section then analyzes the Bellerophon-Anteia conflict as a variant of the widespread Near Eastern \"chaste youth slandered by rejected woman\" motif (cf. Joseph and Potiphar's wife, Bata, Ešmun). The analysis extends to the Chimaera, Pegasos, and parallels with Hippolytos, Phaëthon, and the \"flying heroes\" (Icaros, Idas, Abaris). **Why this matters for Kothar**: This section reveals that Greek hero myths—even those seemingly \"native\" like Bellerophon—preserve Near Eastern mythological structures, divine names, and cult patterns related to healing, the underworld, and the dying-and-rising god. ---",

The section concludes with a comprehensive summary of the entire chapter's thesis on healer-heroes. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This section completes the chain connecting Greek healing mythology to Mesopotamian origins via West Semitic intermediaries, demonstrating that even the most revered Greek medical god—Asclepios—derives from Near Eastern prototypes. ---",

The chapter concludes that Mycenaean civilization was \"essentially a peripheral culture of the Ancient East, its westernmost extension.\"\n\n**Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter provides the physical and documentary proof for the cultural transmission argued in Chapters I–III, establishing that Semitic presence in the Aegean was not merely mythological but archaeologically and epigraphically attested. ---",

The article demonstrates extensive Greco-Semitic religious parallels and contributes to understanding the \"Aegean Oriental religious *koinē*.\"\n\n**Why this matters for Kothar**: This article provides direct textual evidence from Ugarit for the Semitic origins of Greek divine figures, including the prototype of Lucifer, the etymology of Bacchic *thyrsoi*, and the mare-goddess parallel to Black Demeter—all supporting the broader Hellenosemitic thesis. ---",

Using Greek-Eteocypriote and Greek-Eteocretan bilinguals, Gordon demonstrates that the pre-Greek languages of Cyprus and Crete are Northwest Semitic dialects closely related to Phoenician. The bilinguals from Amathus and Dreros provide the \"Rosetta Stones\" that unlock the linguistic identity of the Minoan world. **Why this matters for Kothar**: These bilinguals establish the empirical foundation for the Minoan-Semitic thesis. The Dreros equations (*lmo* = \"for his mother,\" *ihia* = \"it will be\") prove continuity from Bronze Age Minoan through Hellenistic Eteocretan. ---",

He also identifies the conjunction *u* \"and\" as West Semitic rather than East Semitic, revising his earlier position on the Hagia Triada dialect. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This is Gordon's key methodological article establishing Linear A as specifically Phoenician-type West Semitic, providing the linguistic foundation for the Minoan-Semitic thesis that connects Crete to the Canaanite world from which Kothar-wa-Hasis originates. ---",

    "content": "Gordon's footnote 4 provides a crucial insight into how the Hebrews selectively adopted and rejected Canaanite religious institutions:\n\n> \"This illustrates the fact that the Hebrews sometimes **borrowed from** (as in the case of the *kōhănîm*), and at other times **reacted against** (as in the case of the *qĕdēšîm*), their Canaanite milieu.\"\n\n- **Kōhănîm** (כֹּהֲנִים): The legitimate priestly guild, borrowed from Canaanite practice and retained throughout biblical history to the present day\n- **Qĕdēšîm** (קְדֵשִׁים): Temple functionaries associated with Asherah's cult, eliminated by King Josiah around 621 BC (II Kings 23:7)\n\n**Significance**: This demonstrates that Hebrew religion was not created *ex nihilo* but emerged through selective adoption and deliberate rejection of existing Canaanite institutions. The same Ugaritic text documenting both priestly guilds shows they operated side by side in Canaanite religion; Israel's choice to keep one and eliminate the other reveals the theological priorities of emerging Yahwism. **Key quote**: \"The international spread of religious guilds helped disseminate cultic practices and religious beliefs far and wide.\"",

Her brother Cadmus founded Thebes. 'Europa' and 'Cadmus' are an appropriate pair of Semitic names, meaning 'West' and 'East,' respectively.\"\n\n— *Context*: Gordon cites Greek mythological tradition as evidence for the Semitic character of Minoan culture. The names Europa (West) and Cadmus (East) form a complementary pair. > \"The knowledge that the Minoan language was 'Phoenician' persisted until at least the fourth century A.D., when a Latin author, Lucius Septimius, described the accidental discovery of ancient literary texts at Knossos in the reign of Nero. The texts were brought to Nero, who assumed them to be Phoenician and turned them over to Semitists for translation.\"\n\n— *Context*: Gordon notes that ancient tradition preserved knowledge of Minoan as Phoenician, which modern scholarship erroneously rejected. > \"We have rich literary remains from Ugarit, but little so far from Minoan Crete. This is due to the accidents of discovery... Meanwhile the known Minoan texts suffice to bridge the gap between Ugarit and Greece, and show us that Northwest Semites laid the Minoan foundations for Mycenaean civilization: the first Greek culture in recorded history.\"\n\n— *Context*: The concluding statement of the chapter, summarizing Gordon's thesis about the Minoan bridge between Semitic East and Greek West. ---",

Gordon examines royal correspondence, land grants, guild organization, and merchant regulations.

Gordon argues that the Helen-of-Troy motif links the Epic of Kret, the Iliad, and the Patriarchal narratives of Genesis. He explains the anti-Canaanite polemic in the Ten Commandments (particularly the prohibition against coveting) as a reaction to Ugaritic values where Baal was described as a \"coveting god.\" Finally, he traces the transmission of Hurrian theogonic myths (Kumarbi/Zeus) through Minoan Crete to Hesiod. **Why this matters for Kothar**: This chapter represents the culmination of Gordon's argument—that the earliest Greek and Hebrew literatures share a common Northwest Semitic (\"Phoenician\") foundation transmitted through Minoan Crete. The craftsman traditions embodied by Kothar-wa-Hasis, Daedalus, and Bezalel are part of this shared heritage. ---",

Column II narrates Anath's bloodthirsty rampage that nearly destroys mankind—a massacre symbolizing victory, followed by the blessings of peace. Columns III-IV tell how Baal induces Anath to visit his mountain by promising to reveal \"the secret of nature.\" When messengers arrive, Anath fears danger threatens Baal and boasts of her past victories: defeating Yamm (Sea), Tannin (Leviathan), Mot (Death), and other cosmic enemies. **Significance**: This text contains Anath's famous \"battle boast\" listing her defeated enemies—the same monsters (Leviathan, the seven-headed serpent, Tannin) that appear in Isaiah 27:1 and Psalm 74:14.

El approves, and Kothar builds a magnificent palace of cedar, transformed by divine fire into gold and silver. The centerpiece is the \"window controversy\"—Kothar insists on installing a window while Baal refuses, though Baal eventually relents. Gordon notes this reflects the introduction of windowed palaces from Crete to Ugarit, since Minoan architecture featured windows while Ugaritic did not. **Critical Footnote**: This text also preserves the name \"Yw-El\" (Yahweh-El), suggesting Yahweh was originally El's son in pre-Israelite Canaan. ---",

It is usual for a younger god to eclipse the older gods in the development of religion. In other words, just as Zeus eclipsed his father Cronus, Yahweh eclipsed his father El. Subsequently, Hebrew monotheism necessitated the identification of Yahweh with El.\"\n\n**Significance**: This passage provides textual evidence that the divine name Yahweh predates Israelite religion and originally designated a son of El within the Canaanite pantheon. The theological development from polytheistic son-god to monotheistic identification with El parallels the Greek pattern of Zeus superseding Cronus. ---",

Kothar-wa-Hasis brings the boy a wondrous bow. The huntress goddess Anath covets it, offering first wealth, then immortality. Aqhat refuses both, adding that archery is not for women. Anath plots his murder through Yatpan, who strikes him while eagles hover overhead. One eagle devours Aqhat's remains. Drought and famine follow. Danel curses the land, retrieves Aqhat's remains from the mother of eagles, mourns for seven years, then sends his daughter Pughat to exact vengeance. She dons warrior's garb beneath women's clothes and infiltrates Yatpan's camp—where the text breaks off. **Biblical Significance**: Danel's curse parallels David's lament over Gilboa (II Samuel 1:21). Pughat's transvestism explains Deuteronomy's prohibition on cross-dressing. Ezekiel 14:14 and 28:3 mention Danel by name. ---",

El blesses the union with seven sons and a daughter (Octavia). However, Kret fails to fulfill his vow, falls ill, and nearly dies. After divine intervention cures him, his son Yaṣib claims the throne, and Kret curses him. **The Helen-of-Troy Motif**: This epic contains the same wife-retrieval pattern found in Homer's Iliad (Menelaus/Helen/Troy) and Genesis 12, 20 (Abraham/Sarah/Egypt and Gerar). ---",

Harrison demonstrates that religion is fundamentally social and arises from two primal impulses: **expulsion** (riddance of evil) and **impulsion** (enhancement of life), captured in the Chaeronea formula \"Out with Famine, in with Health and Wealth.\" She traces religious development through four stages—totemism, initiation, king-god, and fertility drama—showing how the god emerges as \"desire exteriorized, personified\" from collective ritual. The work also acknowledges new debts to Jung, Freud, and the Russian philosopher Solovíóv. ---",

It is not enough to be killed, you must be torn to pieces or burnt to ashes. Above all you must utterly forget your past life.\" (p. 23)\n\n— Context: Why the death symbolism in initiation is so emphatic. ---",

Two copies exist on front and back of the same stone—suggesting the stone-mason found the material unfamiliar. **Significance**: Palaikastro preserved archaic customs that had died out at Knossos. As Strabo noted, \"when the warlike cities, and especially Knossos, were ravaged, certain customs were kept up among the inhabitants of Lyttos and Gortyna and other lesser towns rather than by the Knossians.\"\n\n---",

Drama lived its life in and through the cult of Dionysos because Dionysos, unlike the other Olympians, was himself in origin a *dromenon*, a thing annually enacted, the New Birth, the year-spirit incarnate.\" (p. 48)\n\n— Context: Why drama belonged to Dionysos specifically, not to any other god. > \"The primitive mind is not occupied in asking 'why?' It is too busy dancing and singing to ask questions. The *dromenon* is not an attempt to explain anything, it is simply a rite, a thing done, done for the good of the tribe, done because it always has been done, done with immediate magical intent.\" (p. 38)\n\n— Context: Against intellectualist theories that see ritual as \"primitive science.\"\n\n---",

Using evidence from \"Hero Feasts,\" the cult of Theseus, and the Oschophoria festival, Harrison demonstrates that the hero takes on the life-history of the Eniautos-Daimon and thereby provides the ritual forms (agon, pathos, messenger, threnos, theophany) that underlie Attic tragedy. ---",

A **Pathos** of the Year-Daimon, generally a ritual or sacrificial death, in which Adonis or Attis is slain by the tabu animal, the *Pharmakos* stoned, Osiris, Dionysus, Pentheus, Orpheus, Hippolytus torn to pieces (σπαραγμός). > 3. A **Messenger**. For this *Pathos* seems seldom or never to be actually performed under the eyes of the audience.... It is announced by a messenger. > 4. A **Threnos** or Lamentation.

I prefer 'Eniautos' to 'year' because to us 'year' means something definitely chronological, a precise segment as it were of spatialized time; whereas *Eniautos*, as contrasted with *etos*, means a period in the etymological sense, a cycle of waxing and waning.\" (p. vii)\n\n---",

First, it is a confident statement about something unknown and therefore practically always untrustworthy; secondly, if it were right and based on real knowledge, then its subject-matter would no longer belong to the realm of religion; it would belong to science or philosophy.\" (p. xii)\n\n---",
